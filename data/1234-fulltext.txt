JUNE 2019 FINAL EXAMS OVERVIEW SCHEDULE JUNE 2019 FULL EXAM SCHEDULE/ROOMS (UPDATED) For the 2018-19 school year SJAM will be aligning its Exam Schedule with the majority of other WRDSB schools following the ‘Exam by Period” model.  We will also be eliminating our Double Day schedules to spread out exams for students and maximize efficiency and study time.  Please do not hesitate to call school administration if you have any questions about this change to our final evaluations. Benefits of the exam by period model include:  students will only have 1 exam per day; no course conflicts; and most exams written in the regular classrooms where students have spent the semester learning with their teachers. FINAL EXAM POLICIES/INSTRUCTIONS: New Block Schedule: See links below for exam dates/rooms.  All exams are written in the morning (starting at 9:00am).  Please see your teacher for details regarding exam length, etc. Absenteeism: Students who miss an exam due to illness must have their parents call to inform the school of the nature of the problem. A DOCTOR’S CERTIFICATE will be required. Lates: Students who are late must sign in at the main office and will be taken to the conflict room to write their exam. Students must arrive before the end of the exam to be allowed to write the exam. Supplies: Student notebooks, coats, etc. should be left in lockers. Only pens, pencils, etc., may be brought to the exam room. Calculators may be used unless specifically disallowed by the teacher setting the exam. Leaving Exam: Students MUST remain for the entire exam period. If your examination ends at a time when others are still writing, students are expected to leave the school quietly and directly. Cafeteria: The cafeteria servery will be closed during exams. Buses: Morning buses will arrive at the usual time to accommodate examinations written at 9:00 a.m. and will leave at the regular time (not immediately after exams finish). Remember to carry your bus pass with you! Inclement Weather/Bus Cancellations:  If any WRDSB buses are cancelled in any geographic area of Waterloo Region, the exam schedule in ALL secondary schools will be postponed to the next day.  If a “snow day” occurs, all exams will be shifted one day (ex. exam scheduled for January 25th would move to January 28th and all other exams would shift back one day).  NOTE – the February 1st PA Day will not be moved if a snow day occurs (has significant impact system wide).  Any snow day cancellations during exams will result in semester 2 starting later (after all exam dates have been completed). Textbook and Library Book Obligations: All textbooks must be returned at the start of each exam. Mark Review: Staff will be available to review course results for every student at the end of exams. Students who are concerned that they may have failed any courses are to contact their Guidance counsellor. Credit Recovery/Credit Rescue: Students in risk of not achieving credits may have the opportunity for credit rescue or recovery during assigned times in the exam period (afternoons and final performance exam/credit recovery rescue day – January 31st) JANUARY 2019 FINAL EXAMS JANUARY 2019 EXAMS – FULL SCHEDULE/ROOMS (UPDATED) Sir John A.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News EXTENDED: Looking for #WeSingOCanada performers Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders EXTENDED: Looking for #WeSingOCanada performers May 30th, 2019 Contents 1Want to participate? 2Video tips 3Rules and Regulations We have extended the deadline for video submissions to Thursday, June 27, 2019. Warm up those vocal cords (or fingers) and show off your Canadian spirit. We are in search of incredible WRDSB talent to help us kick-off a variety of events on the “right note” – and we want you to be the star. We are looking for performances of O Canada that will be played during our public board meetings and other special occasions throughout the school year. If you are a student, staff member, or part of the WRDSB family, we want YOU to showcase your talent and let your diverse Canadian spirit drive your creativity. We might even ask you to attend the meeting or event and perform in person. So, grab your double-double, gather around a Maple tree, call on your friendliest neighbourhood Moose and don’t be afraid to have some fun! Want to participate? If you’re part of a band, a choir, a trio, a duo, or a soloist, then this is for you! Record a video (in landscape) of you or a group singing or performing O Canada in English or French. You can record the video on a computer, tablet, phone or hand-held camera. Ways to submit Once, you have finished your recording, you can: Share it with us on Instagram, Twitter or YouTube using the hashtag #WeSingOCanada, or Submit your video through our Google Form. If you are posting to any of the listed social media channels and your account is “private”, please switch it to “public” so we can see your talent. Additionally, don’t forget to tag us on Twitter at @wrdsb or on Instagram at @wr_dsb. If you are uploading to YouTube, make sure you use the #WeSingOCanada hashtag in the title. The deadline for entries is Thursday, June 27, 2019. If your video is chosen, we will contact you and your parent/caregiver (if you are under 18) to check we have permission to use your video. Video tips Be creative! Feel free to dress up in your most Canadian gear or sing in your first language. Make sure you have plenty of good lighting when you shoot the video but if you’re going to shoot right next to a window, make sure your back is not to the window or we won’t be able to see you, unless of course, it is for creative purposes. Make sure you’re in a quiet place so you get great sound. Wait five seconds after you hit record and before you start singing. Do the same at the end – wait a little bit before you end the recording. We need this to make a smooth edit. If it’s just you singing, get a friend to hold the camera for you (unless you want that selfie vibe, then lean it on a shelf or grab a tripod). Do not stand directly near a wall – we recommend one meter away to reduce shadow. If you need something to sing to, perform with or act as a music key guide, here are a variety of O Canada recordings supplied by the Government of Canada. Rules and Regulations 1) GENERAL: To participate in the “#WeSingOCanada” video campaign conducted by the Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB), you can upload your video to your social media channels using the hashtag #WeSingOCanada. Entries are only valid when submitted with your full name, age and school, and make sure the social media channel you are uploading to is viewable to the public. 2) ELIGIBILITY: The “#WeSingOCanada” video campaign is open to our entire WRDSB community – schools, worksites, students, staff and WRDSB families. Contestants must use the newest version of O Canada lyrics. 3) CONTENT RESTRICTIONS: Your submission must NOT contain material which is sexually explicit or suggestive, obscene, pornographic, violent (e.g., relating to murder, the sales of weapons, cruelty, abuse, etc.), discriminatory (based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion, national origin, physical disability, sexual orientation or age), illegal (e.g. underage drinking, substance abuse, computer hacking, etc.), offensive, threatening, profane, or harassing, or promotes the use of illegal drugs, tobacco, firearms/weapons or any other activities that may appear unsafe or dangerous. Your submission must NOT contain any derogatory references. 4) PERMISSIONS: If your video is chosen, we will get in touch with you and your parent/caregiver (if you are under 18) to check we have permission to use your image.

Many institutions and organizations fly the Pride flag as a celebration of diversity. During the month of June, all Waterloo Region District School Board locations will fly the Pride flag alongside the Canadian flag. We believe that our schools are safe spaces for everyone that walks through our doors. Many of our students, parents, caregivers, staff and community members identify as LGBTQ+. Our strategic plan emphasizes that the well-being of all of our students and staff are met through a focus on equity and inclusion. Raising the Pride flag demonstrates this commitment to our students, staff, parents, caregivers and community members. About the Pride Flag Rainbow flags are flown on federal, provincial and municipal sites, as well as police headquarters and educational institutions all across the country. Its colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet represent life, healing, sunlight, nature, harmony and spirit. The Pride flag is a celebration of diversity and a visual reminder that WRDSB welcomes and supports each and every student – regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. Before making the decision to fly the Pride flag, we checked in with the Government of Canada’s flag protocol lead at Heritage Canada. They confirmed that where schools only have one mast it is an acceptable workaround to show our support and inclusion of LGBTQ+ by flying the Canadian flag first, with the Pride flag beneath. Showing our support for LGBTQ+ does not diminish our respect for our Nation’s flag. We have put together some resources and videos to help answer questions and guide conversations parents and guardians may be having with their children. Help us celebrate Pride month. You can share your stories and pictures with us on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #WRDSBpride.

In order to communicate our current budget outlook for 2019-2020, we are providing the following Frequently Asked Questions to create an understanding of current timelines, resources, and priorities. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on student and staff well-being, work to minimize the impact of budget shortfalls in the classroom, and will be sure to keep you updated as further information becomes available. We are committed to communicating openly with our community and supporting the success of our students – each and every one. As the Waterloo Region District School Board works with the Ministry of Education and navigates the budget and planning process for the 2019-2020 school year, we feel it’s important to provide our students, staff, families, and community members with clear information relating to current budget challenges and potential staffing shortfalls.   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS   What is the anticipated budget shortfall for the WRDSB? Changes to the Grants for Student Needs are expected to create an estimated $12 million shortfall in the WRDSB’s budget.   What is the impact on per-pupil funding? Overall, the WRDSB’s per-pupil funding from the Ministry of Education has been reduced by approximately $2 million. This represents a funding reduction of approximately $110.44 per pupil.   How is the WRDSB planning for larger class sizes? The WRDSB continues to honour the terms of the current Collective Agreements which include a class size ratio of 22:1 at the secondary level.   Will the WRDSB be issuing layoff notices? At this point, we do not anticipate having to lay off staff and are confident we can address current staffing challenges through natural attrition, regular staff leaves, and as an outcome of experiencing growth in our enrolment.   How will the WRDSB make up budget and staffing shortfalls? To address the shortfall, we have taken the first step of redeploying 40+ central staff back in to schools. This will help to minimize impacts on the classroom. We will continue to explore responsible ways to address the remaining shortfall.   Will there be a reduction in service to schools? Yes. Due to the elimination of the central positions, there will be an impact to learning service supports available to schools and we will continue to explore how to best address these changes and examine alternative service delivery models.   What is the staffing process and how has it been impacted by budget shortfalls? The WRDSB is analyzing vacancies, retirements, and enrolment growth in order to reduce, or eliminate, the likelihood of layoffs. We expect that all current full-time staff will be reabsorbed into these vacancies.   When will the staffing process be complete? The staffing process is expected to be complete by the end of May 2019. What are the plans moving forward? As we address the budget shortfall, our priority is to minimize the impact on students. We remain committed to making decisions that are in the best interests of each and every student.   What is next for the budget process? Staff is planning to present a balanced budget to the Board of Trustees in June 2019. The WRDSB expects to receive final budget details (Grants for Student Needs Technical Paper) from the Ministry of Education by the end of May 2019.   Categories: News « Older: Parent/Guardian Survey – Student Transportation Newer: Class of 2019 Grad Wear Available for Order » Sir John A.

Grade 12 students – please be aware that period A grade 12 exams will be written on June 19th (starting at 12:00pm sharp) – see schedule for details. JUNE 2019 FINAL EXAMS OVERVIEW SCHEDULE JUNE 2019 FULL EXAM SCHEDULE/ROOMS (UPDATED) For the 2018-19 school year SJAM will be aligning its Exam Schedule with the majority of other WRDSB schools following the ‘Exam by Period” model.  We will also be eliminating our Double Day schedules to spread out exams for students and maximize efficiency and study time.  Please do not hesitate to call school administration if you have any questions about this change to our final evaluations. Benefits of the exam by period model include:  students will only have 1 exam per day; no course conflicts; and most exams written in the regular classrooms where students have spent the semester learning with their teachers. FINAL EXAM POLICIES/INSTRUCTIONS: New Block Schedule: See links below for exam dates/rooms.  All exams are written in the morning (starting at 9:00am).  Please see your teacher for details regarding exam length, etc. Absenteeism: Students who miss an exam due to illness must have their parents call to inform the school of the nature of the problem. A DOCTOR’S CERTIFICATE will be required. Lates: Students who are late must sign in at the main office and will be taken to the conflict room to write their exam. Students must arrive before the end of the exam to be allowed to write the exam. Supplies: Student notebooks, coats, etc. should be left in lockers. Only pens, pencils, etc., may be brought to the exam room. Calculators may be used unless specifically disallowed by the teacher setting the exam. Leaving Exam: Students MUST remain for the entire exam period. If your examination ends at a time when others are still writing, students are expected to leave the school quietly and directly. Cafeteria: The cafeteria servery will be closed during exams. Buses: Morning buses will arrive at the usual time to accommodate examinations written at 9:00 a.m. and will leave at the regular time (not immediately after exams finish). Remember to carry your bus pass with you! Inclement Weather/Bus Cancellations:  If any WRDSB buses are cancelled in any geographic area of Waterloo Region, the exam schedule in ALL secondary schools will be postponed to the next day.  If a “snow day” occurs, all exams will be shifted one day (ex. exam scheduled for January 25th would move to January 28th and all other exams would shift back one day).  NOTE – the February 1st PA Day will not be moved if a snow day occurs (has significant impact system wide).  Any snow day cancellations during exams will result in semester 2 starting later (after all exam dates have been completed). Textbook and Library Book Obligations: All textbooks must be returned at the start of each exam. Mark Review: Staff will be available to review course results for every student at the end of exams. Students who are concerned that they may have failed any courses are to contact their Guidance counsellor. Credit Recovery/Credit Rescue: Students in risk of not achieving credits may have the opportunity for credit rescue or recovery during assigned times in the exam period (afternoons and final performance exam/credit recovery rescue day – January 31st) JANUARY 2019 FINAL EXAMS JANUARY 2019 EXAMS – FULL SCHEDULE/ROOMS (UPDATED) Sir John A.

Based on a student’s performance on optional AP exams (typically written in spring of grade 12), they may earn a transfer credit, advanced placement or both for that subject in first-year university.  Where applicable, each university decides independently how to recognize successful completion of AP courses/exams and has clear AP policies which students can access through university websites or our own guidance counsellors. AP courses cover BOTH Ontario curriculum and AP content.  Students’ final course marks are based on their demonstration of knowledge of the Ontario curriculum.  Evaluation of AP content occurs during the final standardized exam written in grade 12. Students should consider pre-AP courses (grades 9-11) as more of a mindset than an actual destination stream.  The focus of these courses should be on developing the skills and habits needed for success in grade 12 AP courses, including inquiry, problem solving, critical thinking and creativity, communication and collaboration.  Courses are designed to tap into students’ genuine passions for subject content while providing an enriched environment for those seeking an extra challenge beyond academic or university level. SJAM is proud to offer the following courses as part of our exciting Pre-Advanced Placement (grades 9-11) and Advanced Placement (grade 12) program: GRADE 9 English French (Enriched – for current French Immersion students) Mathematics Science GRADE 10 English French (Enriched – for former French Immersion students) Mathematics Science GRADE 11 Biology Chemistry English French (Enriched – for former French Immersion students) Physics Math (MCR3UW & MHF4UW – one each semester)  GRADE 12 AP COURSES Biology Calculus Chemistry English French (Enriched – for former French Immersion students) Physics Students may apply for one single pre-AP course or up to 3 pre-AP courses (the Grade 11 MCR3UW + MHF4UW count as one selection and are packaged during the same school year – 1 per semester). These courses will be taught by separate teachers. This year applications will be completed via an on-line process (see link above). NOTE – students will NOT be able to select pre-AP or AP level courses in MyWay.  Please select the regular academic or university level for the pre-AP/AP course you plan to take.  Guidance counsellors will change course codes after final approvals for all pre-AP applicants.

Grade 8 Students – Pre-AP application site is NOW OPEN!  Click the link below to visit the site.  Deadline to apply for the coming school year is January 15th, 2018.  Email confirmations will be sent out after completing your application.  Pre-AP decisions will be out by the end of January. PLEASE CHECK OUT THE PDF PRESENTATION BELOW – PROVIDES OVERVIEW OF WHAT TO EXPECT IN GRADE 9, INCLUDING SCHEDULE, ACADEMIC LEVELS, PRE-AP AND MORE! GRADE 8 INFO PRESENTATION GRADE 9 SJAM COURSE CALENDAR SJAM COURSE DESCRIPTIONS SJAM GRADE 9-12 PATHWAYS PLANNING SHEET PRINCIPAL SHORTREED’S GRADE 8 NIGHT REMARKS SJAM STUDENT LIFE – HIGHLIGHT VIDEO SJAM PRE-AP PROGRAM (Deadline Now Passed) FAST FORWARD PROGRAM INFO ACADEMIC PATHWAYS IN ONTARIO HIGH SCHOOLS As you begin to consider which courses to choose for grade 9, make sure you give some careful thought to the academic level you plan to pursue.  Your grade 8 teachers will provide recommendations as you complete your course selections.  Pay close attention to these recommendations, as your current teachers have developed a strong sense of your learning style and what may be most appropriate in grade 9.  Be aware that attempting to switch academic levels after a semester has started can be extremely difficult due to timetable and/or curriculum restrictions. The academic level you choose will help lead to certain pathways through high school and beyond into post-secondary.  SJAM’s guidance staff will assist throughout high school with goal setting, planning and redirection. ACADEMIC LEVEL (ex. ENG1DI) Grade 9 and 10 academic courses can lead to University/Mixed level courses in gr. 11/12 Pathway to University as possible post-secondary destination These courses are for the learner who: Is self-motivated Enjoys reading Perseveres when challenged Benefits from independence Likes to explore beyond related learning Recognizes the need for daily homework and review Good time management skills PRE-AP/ADVANCED PLACEMENT (ex. SNC1DW) Advanced Placement (AP) program offers students the opportunity to pursue university-level studies while still in high school. Students can earn credits for many universities and colleges in Canada and the USA (based on AP exam scores in grade 12). Enrolling in Pre-AP courses prepares students for success in senior (grade 12) Advanced Placement courses. Pre-AP extends the current curriculum and enriches specific learning outcomes.  SJAM offers Pre-AP courses in English,  Mathematics, and Science. We also offer Enriched French for students coming from French Immersion programs. Students entering Grade 9 Pre-AP courses are accepted based on the recommendation by the feeder school staff and SJAM Enrichment Committee. Students recommended by the Grade 8 feeder school must complete the Pre-AP online application. Students also have the flexibility to apply for Pre-AP courses after grade 9. Although Pre-AP extends the curriculum, evaluation is based on the regular academic Ontario curriculum. Visit our Pre-AP/AP page for more information. APPLIED LEVEL (ex. ENG1PI) Can lead to College/Mixed level courses in gr. 11/12 Pathway to College diploma as possible post-secondary destination These courses are for the learner who: Enjoys learning by doing Likes to learn and master essential skills and knowledge Benefits from more structure, smaller class sizes Reads for a specific purpose Completes tasks in a directed environment ESSENTIAL LEVEL – FAST FORWARD (ex. ENG1LB) Can lead to Workplace level courses in gr. 11/12 Pathway designed to prepare students to directly enter the world of work These courses are for the learner who: Benefit from more structure and reinforcement of concepts Benefits from a variety of different activities to learn and master essential skills and knowledge Enjoys learning by doing Smaller class sizes & in-class support OPEN LEVEL (ex.

Good mental health is vital to our well-being. It provides us with a positive world view, helps us to deal with life’s challenges, and supports healthy relationships with our friends, families and communities. Mental health helps us to reach our potential. Who can I talk to at school regarding my child’s mental health concerns? You may find it helpful to speak to your child’s teacher. The school Principal and/or guidance department (in secondary schools) is always a good place to go for help too. They can connect you with other resources you may need. Each school has access to a designated school social worker and psychologist through a referral process that happens at the school. If you are worried about your child’s mental health or safety, or that of someone else, be sure to ask for help from a health care professional.

Based on a student’s performance on optional AP exams (typically written in spring of grade 12), they may earn a transfer credit, advanced placement or both for that subject in first-year university.  Where applicable, each university decides independently how to recognize successful completion of AP courses/exams and has clear AP policies which students can access through university websites or our own guidance counsellors. AP courses cover BOTH Ontario curriculum and AP content.  Students’ final course marks are based on their demonstration of knowledge of the Ontario curriculum.  Evaluation of AP content occurs during the final standardized exam written in grade 12. Students should consider pre-AP courses (grades 9-11) as more of a mindset than an actual destination stream.  The focus of these courses should be on developing the skills and habits needed for success in grade 12 AP courses, including inquiry, problem solving, critical thinking and creativity, communication and collaboration.  Courses are designed to tap into students’ genuine passions for subject content while providing an enriched environment for those seeking an extra challenge beyond academic or university level. SJAM is proud to offer the following courses as part of our exciting Pre-Advanced Placement (grades 9-11) and Advanced Placement (grade 12) program: SJAM is proud to offer the following courses as part of our exciting Pre-Advanced Placement and Advanced Placement program: GRADE 9 English French (Enriched – for current French Immersion students) Mathematics Science GRADE 10 English French (Enriched – for former French Immersion students) Mathematics Science GRADE 11 Biology Chemistry English French (Enriched – for former French Immersion students) Physics Math (MCR3UW & MHF4UW – one each semester)  GRADE 12 AP COURSES Biology Calculus Chemistry English French (Enriched – for former French Immersion students) Physics  Students may apply for one single pre-AP course or up to 3 pre-AP courses (the Grade 11 MCR3UW + MHF4UW count as one selection and are packaged during the same school year – 1 per semester). These courses will be taught by separate teachers. This year applications will be completed via an on-line process (see link above). NOTE – students will NOT be able to select pre-AP or AP level courses in MyWay.  Please select the regular academic or university level for the pre-AP/AP course you plan to take.  Guidance counsellors will change course codes after final approvals for all pre-AP applicants.

Put your “best self” forward when applying.  Make sure your application is as polished as possible (well written, well organized, thorough and complete). Make sure you involve your guidance counsellor and/or teacher(s) in the process as early as possible.  It’s important to seek help when writing essays, determining what to include and where to look for scholarship info.  Don’t wait until the last minute and expect to pull together a strong application.  This includes asking for reference letters, etc. Don’t just focus on “the big ones” – keep in mind the prestigious scholarships have fierce competition from the best and brightest students from across the country.  Many smaller scholarships don’t have as many applicants, giving you a better chance to earn money for post-secondary. Check out the profiles of past winners of the big scholarships (ex. Loran and TD) so you have a better sense of the types of students who have won these coveted awards.  How do you measure up to these top students? Avoid focusing on just the entrance scholarships.  Research what post-secondary institutions can offer for years 2 to 4 and possible graduate studies. Sir John A.

Students can earn credits for many universities and colleges in Canada and the USA. Enrolling in Pre-AP courses prepares students for success in senior (grade 12) Advanced Placement courses. Pre-AP extends the current curriculum and enriches specific learning outcomes.  SJAM offers Pre-AP courses in English,  Mathematics, and Science. We also offer Enriched French for students coming from French Immersion programs. Students entering Grade 9 Pre-AP courses are accepted based on the recommendation by the feeder school staff and SJAM Enrichment Committee. Students recommended by the Grade 8 feeder school must complete the Pre-AP online application. Students also have the flexibility to apply for Pre-AP courses after grade 9. Although Pre-AP extends the curriculum, evaluation is based on the regular academic Ontario curriculum. Visit our Pre-AP/AP page for more information. Fast Forward Magnet Program Program is for students who may or may not be working towards an Ontario Secondary School Diploma but who are intending to go directly to the workplace upon completion of high school. Most students in this program will be working significantly below grade level (typically at least 2 years out of phase) and will have been identified (IPRC/IEP) as candidates for this program in elementary school. Refer to the Fast Forward program page for more information. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS How big is SJAM? Approximately 1,400 students. Roughly 300 grade 9 students who come from our main feeder schools (Centennial and Laurelwood and Edna Staebler) and more than 16 Fast Forward feeder schools. What will my schedule look like? SJAM is a semestered school, which means you’ll have 4 courses each semester. Semester 1 runs from September to January.  Semester 2 runs from February to June. All classes are 75 minutes in length with 5 minute breaks between A/B and D/E. We run on a 2-day schedule.  Any odd day of the month is a Day 1 schedule.  Any even day is a day 2 schedule.  On day 2, your afternoon periods flip (E, followed by D). What happens if I get lost? A variety of orientation activities during the spring of grade 8 and early September will help students become familiar with our building. Remember that only afternoon classes flip every day, so keeping track of your schedule is easy and takes very little time to get used to. Staff and students alike are friendly and will help you find your way.  Just ask! How tough are high school courses? Expect high school courses to challenge you, but they should not be significantly more difficult than your courses in Grade 8. Your guidance counselor and Grade 8 core teachers can advise you on the appropriate level of difficulty for Grade 9. Remember to keep up with work on a daily basis. Who can I talk to if I’m having problems? Homeroom teacher, who students see every day (first period). Guidance Counselor, who can help with academic, career and personal issues. Child and Youth workers (CYWs) and Social Worker assigned to the school. Classroom teachers and/or Learning Assistance Centre (L.A.C.). Administrators and secretaries in the Main Office. Are there extra-curricular activities SJAM? Yes, and lots of them! Sports teams, arts activities or clubs to satisfy virtually every interest! Check out the Activities page for more info! Arts opportunities, including choirs, instrumental groups, dance and drama productions. Competitive and Intramural sports teams are offered over three seasons (fall, winter and spring). Some teams limit the number of participants, but many will take all who commit to regular practice.  You can participate in up to 3 sports in one school year! Grade 9 students are encouraged to get involved. Involved students adapt more quickly to high school life and tend to be happier and more productive.           Sir John A.

The cap is more accurately termed a 34 credit threshold because it places a limitation on funding and not on participation by students in courses. Understanding the 34 Credit Threshold: All successfully completed credits which can be counted toward the Ontario Secondary School Diploma will count toward the 34 credit threshold. These credits include: All successfully completed courses at day school, night school, summer school and international language school. All successfully completed retake credits (for upgrading marks, etc.). Retaking a passed course for upgrading purposes will result in an additional credit towards the 34 credit threshold. Credits earned outside school (ex. Royal Conservatory of Music, etc.). Specific Exemptions: The Ministry has identified the following exemptions from the 34 credit threshold: Students with Individual Education Plans (IEPs);  The IEP must have been in place prior to the student writing the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT) and/or evidence the IEP has been in place for multiple years, unless there are extenuating circumstances (i.e., trauma). Students who are enrolled in their first four consecutive years of secondary school and have earned more than 34 credits. If these students return for subsequent years, funding for any additional credits would be at the continuing education rate; Reach-ahead credits do not indicate the beginning of a secondary school (i.e., the number of years would not start until the student is enrolled in grade 9). Credit courses in English as a Second Language (ESL) and English Literacy Development (ELD); Credit courses in Actualisation linguistique en francais (ALF), and Programme d’appui aux nouveaux arrivants (PANA) (i.e., courses for student’s entering the WRDSB from an Ontario French Language School Board).  Students Approaching or Exceeding the 34 Credit Threshold (4th or 5th Year Students): The school must determine a student’s number of earned eligible threshold credits prior to the start of each academic year (non-semester schools) or semester. In general, a student planning on returning to high school for a 5th year should only plan on returning for one semester and should not exceed the 34 credit cap. If the student’s number of earned eligible threshold credits at the end of the school year/semester: meets or exceeds 34, the student will be directed to a continuing education program. is 32 to 33, the student may enrol in 2 or fewer* credits in the next semester is 30 to 31, the student may enrol in 4 or fewer* credits in the next semester Sir John A.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 1.    HOW DO I APPLY FOR EARLY ADMISSION? You can’t apply for early admission to Canadian universities.  Universities send out limited early offers of admission based on final grade 11 marks AND any completed grade 12 courses.  Students who receive early offers typically have very high grade 11 marks well above admission cut-offs. 2.    WHAT IF MY GRADE 11 MARKS AREN’T THAT GOOD? While universities may use grade 11 marks when considering students for early admission, they don’t penalize students for lower grades in their grade 11 year.  The only marks that may be a factor in decisions are any completed 4U/M marks. 3.    HOW DO I LET UNIVERSITIES KNOW WHICH ARE MY TOP 6 MARKS? You don’t – universities do this automatically. If you have more than the required 6 4U/M courses, universities will consider your best 6 when calculating your admission average.  In most cases, any required course for a university program will be used to calculate admission average, regardless of whether or not it is one of your top 6 final marks. 4.    ONCE I RECEIVE AN OFFER, DO THE MARKS THAT COME AFTER MATTER? Absolutely!  Make sure you’ve carefully read any conditions in your university offer.  Every year, students start to coast in the last part of the year and it’s quite common for marks to drop.  Be careful you don’t let marks slide below the minimum acceptable average outlined in your offer or you may have that offer rejected. 5.    WILL I BE PENALIZED FOR REPEATED COURSES? In most cases, universities will accept the higher mark for a repeated course.  Some highly competitive programs do have strict guidelines regarding retakes.  Check with your school/faculty of choice or speak to your guidance counsellor. 6.    DO UNIVERSITIES DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DAY SCHOOL, SUMMER SCHOOL, ETC.? No.  Universities accept marks from any accredited Ontario educational institution.  You will not be penalized for taking courses outside of regular day classes, but some universities/programs may ask for additional information regarding these classes. Be aware that courses taken during summer school AFTER June of your graduating year are rarely accepted by universities for admission consideration. 7.    I’M OFF TO UNIVERSITY…WHERE WILL MY FUTURE DEGREE TAKE ME? Check out this AMAZING resource put together by Queen’s University – MY MAJOR MAP.  Great, real-life examples of what university grads are doing with their various degrees and/or undergrad experiences!

Wide program selection Did you know there are over 5,000 different college programs available in Ontario? Programs ranges from 1-year certificates to 4-year degrees. Many programs also focus on specific career training based on current job market demands. 3. Many locations With 28 colleges spread throughout Ontario, and many separate satellite campuses in even more communities, you don't have to travel that far from home to experience what college has to offer. 4. Smaller classes Most colleges provide much smaller classes than universities, allowing you to make valuable, personal connections with instructors and classmates. 5.

When deciding on possible post-secondary pathways, you need to determine which choice best fits your personal goals.  Colleges offer many exciting career-specific programs worth exploring, with most offering genuine hands-on, practical experience to prepare you for the “real world.”  If you already have a clear career focus, college may be for you! Check out the video below if you’re thinking about college as a potential post-secondary pathway.  WHAT DO I NEED TO APPLY? Admission requirements for Ontario colleges are quite different from universities.  While Ontario universities all require 6 grade 12 4U/M credits to apply, colleges vary significantly from school to school and program to program.  Typically, you need an Ontario high school diploma (OSSD) or equivalent to apply (or mature student status).Since colleges offer a range of program options (certificate, diploma, degree, apprenticeships), it is very important to research the detailed requirements for the program you’re interested in. In some cases, a program may require specific high school credits (ex. ENG4CI or MAP4CI) or other acceptable post-secondary upgrade courses.  You may also have to complete tests, essays or interviews or submit portfolios of work. Take the time to contact the colleges to find out what you need – CLICK HERE TO VIEW CONTACT INFO! Most college websites offer excellent information to help you determine what’s required to apply.  Highly competitive programs have even more rigorous requirements.  Check out the Ontario Colleges information page HERE to help you with this process and make sure to check the specifics for your potential program.As part of your research, consider visiting the schools you’re interested in to make sure they’re a good fit for you!  Remember – you may be committing one to four years of your life to a college, so choose the one that best suits your interests, goals and personality. HELPFUL TIP: Many colleges host open-houses in the fall and spring or you can contact the schools for a personal tour.  Also check with your school’s guidance department to see if it’s hosting a college information fair.  HOW DO I APPLY? The application process to apply to college is fairly straight-forward.  Check out the Ontario Colleges video below for the basic steps required.  Here are a few key points to get you started: 2014 APPLICATION FEE – $95 (non-refundable – have a payment method handy when registering online) Application fee gives you up to 5 programs choices (max. 3 at any one college) and all programs must be in the same academic year (August to July) List choices in order of preference (especially if applying to multiple programs at the same college) If you are currently enrolled at a high school in Ontario, your marks will automatically be uploaded to OCAS for you – no need to order transcripts from your school! Visit the Ontario Colleges “HOW TO APPLY” page here for more info!  HOW DO I PAY FOR COLLEGE? Did you know that the tuition and program costs for many college programs are significantly lower than university?  Here’s a breakdown from of average tuition rates for one academic year from OntarioColleges.ca: Diploma Programs – $2,400 Graduate Certificate Programs – $3,600 Bachelor’s Degree Programs – $6,100 Compare those amounts to an average annual tuition of almost $8,500 for a regular program at an Ontario university in 2014 (Toronto Star).  Over a few years of study, college can save you thousands. To help you cover some of the costs of your college program, make sure you research available bursaries, scholarships and awards at the colleges you’re considering. You can also apply for OSAP (student loans) or up to 30% tuition grant (money you don’t have to pay back). Be aware that you can’t apply for financial assistance until you’ve committed to a specific college.  Make sure you apply early to guarantee you’ll receive the maximum amount you’re eligible for.

Cooperative education is a planned learning experience that integrates classroom theory and learning experiences at the workplace. It allows students to “learn by doing” and “to do while learning”. The student has a chance to investigate and confirm career decisions before selecting work or post-secondary education destinations. It is an excellent opportunity for senior students to experience the world of work while obtaining high school credits. Students must complete an application and interview to be accepted into the cooperative education program at Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School. Students need to keep in mind that employers expect a base foundation of knowledge and, as a result, students should have taken the related school course(s) prior to being placed in the workplace. The Fast Forward GLD – Discovering the Workplace package offers an extended classroom component to assist in the development of essential workplace skills. The workplace portion of the program allows students to transfer skills developed in the classroom to the world of work.

Courses are offered in French from grade 9 to grade 12 and also in Spanish at the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. Our students have opportunities for advanced study and cultural immersion abroad through different exchange programs. Language Department teachers work to prepare students for University level studies through traditional text-based learning and innovative materials and techniques. Supplementary tools such as audio-visuals, software and Internet sources spark student interest and augment classroom instruction. Teachers tailor lesson plans to meet students’ individual needs and maximize their involvement. As a result, students gain an understanding of another language and an appreciation of its culture.  So why should you study another language?  To learn how to communicate better with others To gain perspective on yourself and on your own culture To gain an appreciation and understanding of other cultures, traditions and languages To gain a deeper understanding of the nature of language itself And most of all: To gain skills that will be useful in whatever future career you may choose.  Teachers in the Languages Department: Madame C.

Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home Athletics SJAM Athletics Code of Conduct Toggle navigation Subnav Athletics SJAM Alumni Athlete Hall of Fame SJAM Athletics Code of Conduct Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders SJAM Athletics Code of Conduct Team players are privileged to represent Sir John A. Macdonald and should conduct themselves as suitable ambassadors for our school at all times. All Students are responsible to the principal for their conduct at any school event. This includes all games, practices and tournaments.  Students are required to conduct themselves in accordance with WRDSB policy for all school-related activities.  Student-athletes are expected to be role-models and ambassadors of inclusive, team-building behaviour.  Highlander Athletics does not condone any threatening, bullying or abusive behaviour toward any student.  Any hazing-type activities are strictly forbidden.  Behavioural misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action. It is a privilege to be on a Sir John A. Macdonald team not a right! Game ejections and unsportsmanlike conduct may be subject to further administrative disciplinary actions upon review. ACADEMICS: Players are expected to be conscientious students, and good citizens of the school. Sport-related absences are considered valid however, work missed because of athletic activities must be completed to the teachers’ satisfaction. All athletes must be enrolled in a full-time program, if they are in Grades 9, 10 or 11.  All athletes should communicate their absences to the classroom teacher in advance of the event. SPORTSMANSHIP: SJAM players will display good sportsmanship, at all times. Good sportsmanship means showing respect in dealing with teammates, coaches, opposition, officials and spectators.  All fans are expected to show good sportsmanship and keep all cheering positive. TRANSPORTATION: Strict adherence to school rules while on buses or visiting other schools is expected. Students must be transported in vehicles arranged by the school, unless otherwise approved. FEES/UNIFORMS: Players must purchase a Student Card to be eligible to play sports at SJAM.  There will be a minimum team fee for each team.  These fees have been pre-determined by the Student Activity Directors and are uniform across the county.  These fees help to subsidize the cost of athletics to the student body.  There may be additional fees for tournaments and extras as determined by the coach. School uniforms must be in good repair and washed upon their return. Team uniforms are to be worn for team activities only.  Students will be responsible for the cost of damaged or missing uniforms. The cost of high school sports is far cheaper than community or private sports. PLAYING TIME: We are committed to the development of all our student-athletes, however, athletic teams are competitive and playing time is NOT guaranteed, nor is it equitable.  Playing time is up to the sole discretion of the coaching staff.  Coaches will be clear about their expectations with respect to playing time.  Players are encouraged to talk directly with their coach if they are not happy with playing time – it is not fair to coaches or other players to have parental interference with respect to playing time.  This means that some athletes could get very little or no playing time at all.  If you are not comfortable with this, then please do not commit to playing for a competitive team at SJAM. ATTENDANCE: In order to play on a specific game day, players must be in attendance at school and in class, unless the coach has been forewarned of a valid reason (ie doctor’s appointment).  All absences must be communicated to the attendance office for validation.  Players must participate in physical education classes on game days. INJURIES: All injuries must be reported to the coach. If warranted, the coach will fill out a Risk Management form. VALUABLES: Players are responsible for the safekeeping of their own valuables during practices, games or field trips.  Students should leave their valuables in their lockers. DRUGS/ALCOHOL: Consumption of drugs or alcohol is forbidden at any time, on any school premises, or at any school. Alcohol or drug consumption at any school-sporting event or activity is strictly forbidden.  Students will be subject to disciplinary action by the principal. **  Students breaking this rule will be removed from the team for the remainder of the season and suspended indefinitely from all sports teams, pending a meeting with the principal, coach and head of Phys. ed** SMOKING: Since smoking is not considered a good health practice, players are expected to refrain from smoking at least during the sports season. Smoking at any school event or activity is strictly forbidden, regardless of location. COMMITMENT: Once the commitment to a school team has been made, a player must follow through with his/her commitment to the team. It is unfair to teammates and coaches to leave a team mid-season. It is also unfair to other aspiring players who have failed to earn a place on that team. Any player who quits a school team during the season, or is removed by the coach for reasons of commitment or behaviour, will be ineligible to play on any Sir John A. Macdonald school team for one full calendar year. Any absences by the athlete from practices or games must be discussed with the coach beforehand or as soon after the absence as possible. Excessive absences could lead to removal from a school team, at the discretion of the coach and/or the administration.  This will result in the player being ineligible for 1 calendar year.  Players must abide by any decision made by the coaches. Students may leave the team without penalty, until the commitment date – as given by the coach. Under exceptional circumstances, arrangements can be made for a player to leave a team without penalty, pending approval of the Coach, Head of Phys-ed and Principal. Teams with insufficient interest re: attendance at practices, poor effort, attitude, etc. will be subject to cancellation. **GENERAL STATEMENT** The Athletes’ Code of Conduct has been constructed to assist players, coaches and administration in making Sir John A. Macdonald’s Athletic Program rewarding for all those involved. The rules contained in the code are not designed to limit participation, but rather to ensure respect and dedication for the Athletic Program and the individuals involved in it.  It is a privilege to be on a Highlander athletic team.

Macdonald Secondary School.  I am so impressed with the caliber of the staff and students here at SJAM. We provide everything a student could want in their own community school. We are proud of our academic achievements. Every year our students excel in the Grade 9 EQAO Mathematics test and the Grade 10 Literacy test scoring among the top schools in the county and the province. In fact, the Fraser Institute consistently ranks SJAM as one of the top Secondary Schools in Waterloo Region. SJAM introduced a successful Advanced Placement Program in 2012. Pre AP courses are offered in Grade 9 English, Mathematics, Science and French and continue in grades 10, 11 and 12. We are also proud of our Fast Forward Program which provides exciting opportunities for students who plan to transition to work after high school. Every year brings numerous artistic productions – Sears Drama, or a school musical or play, DanceFest. We have the largest DECA Business team in the Region and numerous other clubs and activities for our students. As for our Athletic program, our record speaks for itself. We offer a comprehensive range of sports teams coached by our enthusiastic and qualified staff. We also offer the opportunity for FF and Applied level students to participate in the Inner City Athletics league. Transitioning to high school is a big step. Let me highlight two students who chose SJAM, their community school. Sarah McCuaig graduated from SJAM in 2009. She was also offered numerous scholarships and was accepted into a Medical Sciences Program at McGill. She recently earned the extremely prestigious Rhodes Scholarship which will take her to Oxford in England to study for 3 years. I spoke to Sarah when she visited her teachers here this past Christmas. She was passionate in her belief that her decision to attend SJAM provided the foundation for the young woman she has become. David Zhang, who graduated from SJAM in June 2012 was recently awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. David received major entrance scholarships to numerous universities and had his choice of program. David was an SJAM co-Prime Minister and is equally passionate about his experiences at SJAM. The list of impressive graduates is long. SJAM is a fine school with an excellent reputation both in this community and across Canada. Best Regards Jennifer Shortreed, Principal Sir John A.

Students are expected to dress in a manner appropriate for a learning/working environment. Students will abide by school dress code policies as outlined in the SJAM Student Handbook: Clothing must cover the torso in an appropriate manner. The showing of undergarments (e.g., bras, bra straps, muscle shirts, boxer shorts) is never appropriate. Offensive clothing or logos (e.g., condoning drugs, alcohol, inappropriate language or innuendo, gang affiliation or discrimination) is never appropriate. Bandanas and gang “colours” are not permitted. Hats are permitted at school but must be removed as a sign a respect during the playing of the National Anthem, during assemblies, in the Main Office and in classroom teaching areas (at the discretion of the teacher). Students who are dressed inappropriately for school may be instructed to change into more appropriate clothing or may be sent home. If you have questions or concerns regarding SJAM’s dress code, please contact the main office.   Sir John A.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News WANTED: Performers for #WeSingOCanada Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders WANTED: Performers for #WeSingOCanada May 1st, 2019 Contents 1Want to participate? 2Video tips 3Rules and Regulations It’s time to thaw out from the cold, warm up those vocal cords (or fingers), and show off your Canadian spirit. We are in search of incredible WRDSB talent to help us kick-off a variety of events on the “right note” – and we want you to be the star. We are looking for performances of O Canada that will be played during our public board meetings and other special occasions throughout the school year. If you are a student, staff member, or part of the WRDSB family, we want YOU to showcase your talent and let your diverse Canadian spirit drive your creativity. We might even ask you to attend the meeting or event and perform in person. So, grab your double-double, gather around a Maple tree, call on your friendliest neighbourhood Moose and don’t be afraid to have some fun! Want to participate? If you’re part of a band, a choir, a trio, a duo, or a soloist, then this is for you! Record a video (in landscape) of you or a group singing or performing O Canada in English or French. You can record the video on a computer, tablet, phone or hand-held camera. Once, you have finished your recording, share it with us on Instagram, Twitter or YouTube using the hashtag #WeSingOCanada or submit your video through our Google Form. If you’re sharing it with us on any of the above social media channels, don’t forget to tag us on Twitter at @wrdsb or on Instagram at @wr_dsb. If you are uploading to YouTube, make sure you use the #WeSingOCanada hashtag in the title. If you are posting to any of the listed social media channels and your account is “private”, please switch it to “public” so we can see your talent. The deadline for entries is Thursday, May 31, 2019. If your video is chosen, we will contact you and your parent/caregiver (if you are under 18) to check we have permission to use your video. Video tips Be creative! Feel free to dress up in your most Canadian gear or sing in your first language. Make sure you have plenty of good lighting when you shoot the video but if you’re going to shoot right next to a window, make sure your back is not to the window or we won’t be able to see you, unless of course, it is for creative purposes. Make sure you’re in a quiet place so you get great sound. Wait five seconds after you hit record and before you start singing. Do the same at the end – wait a little bit before you end the recording. We need this to make a smooth edit. If it’s just you singing, get a friend to hold the camera for you (unless you want that selfie vibe, then lean it on a shelf or grab a tripod). Do not stand directly near a wall – we recommend one meter away to reduce shadow. If you need something to sing to, perform with or act as a music key guide, here are a variety of O Canada recordings supplied by the Government of Canada. Rules and Regulations 1) GENERAL: To participate in the “#WeSingOCanada” video campaign conducted by the Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB), you can upload your video to your social media channels using the hashtag #WeSingOCanada. Entries are only valid when submitted with your full name, age and school, and make sure the social media channel you are uploading to is viewable to the public. 2) ELIGIBILITY: The “#WeSingOCanada” video campaign is open to our entire WRDSB community – schools, worksites, students, staff and WRDSB families. Contestants must use the newest version of O Canada lyrics. 3) CONTENT RESTRICTIONS: Your submission must NOT contain material which is sexually explicit or suggestive, obscene, pornographic, violent (e.g., relating to murder, the sales of weapons, cruelty, abuse, etc.), discriminatory (based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion, national origin, physical disability, sexual orientation or age), illegal (e.g. underage drinking, substance abuse, computer hacking, etc.), offensive, threatening, profane, or harassing, or promotes the use of illegal drugs, tobacco, firearms/weapons or any other activities that may appear unsafe or dangerous. Your submission must NOT contain any derogatory references. 4) PERMISSIONS: If your video is chosen, we will get in touch with you and your parent/caregiver (if you are under 18) to check we have permission to use your image.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News A Message Regarding the Attack in San Diego Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders A Message Regarding the Attack in San Diego April 29th, 2019 Over the weekend, the world experienced yet another act of violence. On Saturday, April 27, one person was killed and at least three others were wounded as a result of a terrorist attack at a Synagogue near San Diego, California. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the victims, their families, and their loved ones, as well as the entire community. We hope for the swift recovery of those who were injured. This tragic event is a reminder of the importance of creating a safe, caring, and inclusive community. The Waterloo Region District School Board is committed to providing education that is supportive of all our students, families, staff, and community members. Every day, we work to ensure everyone in our schools feels a deep sense of belonging, acceptance, and knows that they are valued. We would also like to offer our utmost support to the Jewish community. Flags at all WRDSB sites will be lowered to half-mast until end of day on Friday, May 3. It is important in times like these, that we make an extra effort to connect with one another, offer our support, and share our feelings of vulnerability. It is also important that we all work together to maintain our safe and caring school communities. We would like to remind our schools that supports are available for anyone who is struggling. Please reach out by talking to a friend, a parent, a teacher or a colleague and connecting with the appropriate resources. We are fortunate to live in a supportive community where we can lean on one another in times like this. John Bryant, Director of Education   SUPPORT & GUIDANCE It can be difficult to know how to respond to these kinds of events. To help students, parents and staff, we are providing some simple guidelines that you can use to inform your conversations over the coming days. Guidance for students You belong here and we care about you – each and every one. You are part of a strong school community that comes together when any among us feels afraid or vulnerable. If you need to talk, reach out to a trusted adult at school, home, or in your community. If someone reaches out to you, listen. Pay special attention to how you treat others this week, especially those who may be questioning how they belong. Be kind, be welcoming, and include everyone. Guidance for elementary student parents/guardians People are talking about these events, so recognize that children may become concerned that something bad will happen to them, their family or friends. Explain that safety measures are in place and reassure them that you and other adults will take care of them. If your child is not focused on the events, do not dwell on them. Try to avoid having detailed adult conversations regarding the tragedy in front of children. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. Young children may not be able to express themselves verbally. Pay attention to changes in their behaviour or social interactions. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Young children, in particular, may not be able to distinguish between images on television and their personal reality. Older children may choose to watch the news; be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your children know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner. Guidance for secondary student parents/guardians Bring up the topic at a time and place where a discussion can occur. If there are distractions, a shortage of time or if either you or your teen is too tired or busy, it is likely the conversation will not be completed. If your teen is not focused on the tragedy, do not dwell on it. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. It is normal for people to try to make sense of things when a serious loss occurs. Allow your teen to share his or her ideas and speculations. Help them to separate what they know from what they are guessing about. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Teenagers may choose to watch the news—be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children and teens feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your teen know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner.     Categories: News « Older: WRDSB flags at half-mast this weekend for National Day of Mourning Newer: Class of 2019 Commencement – Wed.

Spring is a great time to get active outdoors. Active transportation, such as walking and wheeling to school, not only helps children increase their physical activity, but it also allows them to connect to nature and reduce their ecological footprint. Since walking or wheeling to school has many benefits, we encourage you to join us and help inspire students to use active travel more regularly. Share your photos and videos of your spring walk to school using the hashtag #SpringWalkDay on Twitter and Instagram. Be sure to tag us. Happy walking!

In June 2017, our Board of Trustees passed a motion for staff to review the French Immersion program in the WRDSB. This review will look at equitable access to French programs for each student, staffing challenges, transportation, and how French Immersion is offered in our schools. As part of the review, we are surveying our school communities to find out more about their experience with the French Immersion program, barriers they faced when enrolling children in the program and what impacted their decision to enrol or not enrol their children in the French Immersion program. Families are encouraged to participate in the survey to share their experiences with us. The survey is available for three weeks, starting on April 23, 2019. It is open to everyone, not only families of past and present students in French Immersion.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News A Message Regarding the Attacks in Sri Lanka Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders A Message Regarding the Attacks in Sri Lanka April 23rd, 2019 On Easter Sunday, we awoke to news of yet another senseless attack in Sri Lanka, that has left over 300 people dead and several others wounded. We stand together in grieving this tragedy with our Christian community and those affected. We are a school district for all of Waterloo Region, no matter what your background or beliefs. We are committed to ensuring our schools and communities are safe, caring and inclusive spaces where each student, staff member, family and community member feel valued. We want everyone in our schools to experience a deep sense of belonging and acceptance. It is essential that we all pay attention to how we greet and connect with each other in the coming days. We must all watch, listen, reach out and show that we care about one another. Support is available for anyone who is feeling vulnerable – at any time. Please encourage anyone who is struggling to seek out that support by talking to a friend, a parent, a teacher or a colleague. I am grateful that we are a community that supports and cares for each other, and that we can lean on one another in times like this.   John Bryant, Director of Education   SUPPORT & GUIDANCE It can be difficult to know how to respond to these events. To help students, parents and staff, we are providing some simple guidelines that you can use to inform your conversations over the coming days. Guidance for students You belong here and we care about you – each and every one. You are part of a strong school community that comes together when any among us feels afraid or vulnerable. If you need to talk, reach out to a trusted adult at school, home, or in your community. If someone reaches out to you, listen. Pay special attention to how you treat others this week, especially those who may be questioning how they belong. Be kind, be welcoming, and include everyone. Guidance for elementary student parents/guardians People are talking about these events, so recognize that children may become concerned that something bad will happen to them, their family or friends. Explain that safety measures are in place and reassure them that you and other adults will take care of them. If your child is not focused on the events, do not dwell on them. Try to avoid having detailed adult conversations regarding the tragedy in front of children. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. Young children may not be able to express themselves verbally. Pay attention to changes in their behaviour or social interactions. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Young children, in particular, may not be able to distinguish between images on television and their personal reality. Older children may choose to watch the news; be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your children know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner. Guidance for secondary student parents/guardians Bring up the topic at a time and place where a discussion can occur. If there are distractions, a shortage of time or if either you or your teen is too tired or busy, it is likely the conversation will not be completed. If your teen is not focused on the tragedy, do not dwell on it. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. It is normal for people to try to make sense of things when a serious loss occurs. Allow your teen to share his or her ideas and speculations. Help them to separate what they know from what they are guessing about. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Teenagers may choose to watch the news—be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children and teens feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your teen know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner. After a tragic incident, it can be difficult to know what to do to support children and youth who have been affected or influenced by these events. You may observe that students appear upset, sad, anxious or tired, and/or you may notice a range of physical complaints. Reactions will vary according to students’ development stage, physical or emotional proximity to the event, and prior experience with traumatic circumstances. In the days, and sometimes weeks, following a tragic event, these reactions are not uncommon and typically will subside over time as students have an opportunity to talk through feelings, to be reassured that they are safe and protected, and to gain perspective. To provide needed support for your students, remember that you need to engage in your own self-care. Tragic events affect individuals in different ways, and you are not immune to the impact of these circumstances. Take time to process your thoughts and emotions with colleagues, friends, family, or using professional mental health assistance as needed, so that you are able to be present and helpful to students. Please remember there are resources available to you via Employee Wellness. Guidance for Educators As a caring adult in students’ lives, there are many ways you can provide support: Maintain a calm classroom environment Support students as they work through strong feelings after a tragic event, in the course of daily school life Notice when a student is struggling and may require additional support Offer classroom accommodations to students struggling with social-emotional concerns after a tragic event Assist struggling students and their families to access more intensive support, as needed Guidance for Staff Take the opportunity to process the situation and your feelings with your friends, family and colleagues Keep regular schedules and routines Remember to eat, sleep, play, exercise, and laugh Practice positive ways of coping with sadness, fear, anger, and worry Ask for help. This is not an experience that you have to face alone. Categories: News « Older: Class of 2019 Prom – Wed.

Across the province, students are talking about walking out to demonstrate their feelings about the recent changes announced regarding our public education system and their upcoming high school experience. As educators, we respect the right of students to express their voice in a positive and respectful way, where such actions are peaceful and safe, and do not hinder the safe passage of people in our schools or the opportunity for learning and academic success. We would ask that students organizing the event inform the office of their plans, so that we can ensure teachers are aware, and that we provide adequate supervision in the area We will be making our expectations clear, should students decide to peacefully protest on that day. We would ask that, as a family, you discuss them with your child(ren) as well. They are as follows: Protests must be peaceful and respectful (adhere to the school code of conduct). Students choosing to participate should become informed on why they are protesting. Students should remain on school grounds at all times.  School staff are unable to supervise students who choose to leave school property. Students choosing not to participate must be allowed to do so, without pressure. Students choosing to participate will be marked absent from their class(es) and may be missing previously scheduled assessments.

Across the province, students are talking about walking out to demonstrate their feelings about the recent changes announced regarding our public education system and their upcoming high school experience. As educators, we respect the right of students to express their voice in a positive and respectful way, where such actions are peaceful and safe, and do not hinder the safe passage of people in our schools or the opportunity for learning and academic success. We would ask that students organizing the event inform the office of their plans, so that we can ensure teachers are aware, and that we provide adequate supervision in the area We will be making our expectations clear, should students decide to peacefully protest on that day. We would ask that, as a family, you discuss them with your child(ren) as well. They are as follows: Protests must be peaceful and respectful (adhere to the school code of conduct). Students choosing to participate should become informed on why they are protesting. Students should remain on school grounds at all times.  School staff are unable to supervise students who choose to leave school property. Students choosing not to participate must be allowed to do so, without pressure. Students choosing to participate will be marked absent from their class(es) and may be missing previously scheduled assessments.

Posted February 23, 2015 The WRDSB has put in place a frigid temperature threshold in our severe weather procedure primarily for three reasons related to the safety of our students: 1. According to Environment Canada, at -35C exposed skin can freeze within 10 minutes. Environment Canada indicates that in temperatures between -28 to -39 there is a high risk of exposed skin freezing (frostnip or frostbite). This temperature is very unusual for our region and some students may not have the appropriate clothing to protect themselves. 2. Most students will take longer than 10 minutes to walk to school and the bused students may wait for an extended period of time should any bus be delayed. 3. We are unable to guarantee crossing guard service to our students as individual crossing guards have a right to maintain their safety given that they are exposed for extended periods of time in frigid temperatures. The Education Centre remains open and is fully operational.

Categories: Broadcast Why were our schools closed Friday? Posted February 23, 2015 The WRDSB has put in place a frigid temperature threshold in our severe weather procedure primarily for three reasons related to the safety of our students: 1. According to Environment Canada, at -35C exposed skin can freeze within 10 minutes. Environment Canada indicates that in temperatures between -28 to -39 there is a high risk of exposed skin freezing (frostnip or frostbite). This temperature is very unusual for our region and some students may not have the appropriate clothing to protect themselves. 2. Most students will take longer than 10 minutes to walk to school and the bused students may wait for an extended period of time should any bus be delayed. 3. We are unable to guarantee crossing guard service to our students as individual crossing guards have a right to maintain their safety given that they are exposed for extended periods of time in frigid temperatures. The Education Centre remains open and is fully operational.

As part of the 2017-18 Pupil Accommodation Grant – School Renewal Allocation, provided by the Ministry of Education, to address the cost of repairing and renovating schools and infrastructure, Waterloo Region District School Board will receive approximately $9.8 million. “This funding brings us another step closer to ensuring we provide the best education for generations to come,” said Ron Dallan, manager of capital projects. “We’re proud of the education we provide to students in the Waterloo Region.” This commitment by the provincial government will improve infrastructure and programs–region wide. There is a lot of work to be done and facilities staff are currently determining the projects that will receive funding. “These funds will continue our ongoing program of maintenance to ensure schools are in the best condition for a successful learning environment,” said John Bryant, director of education. “Our facilities staff do a wonderful job keeping our schools safe, clean and up to date.” Robust public education facilities and services are only part of our purpose. Waterloo Region District School Board continues to work hard working hard with community partners, parents and caregivers to ensure education and student success is a partnership. During the 2016-17 school year, similar funding supported a number of projects, including: Eastwood Collegiate Institute’s theatre received phase 1 of their upgrade. Forest Heights Collegiate Institute’s music room will receive an upgrade. Grand River Collegiate Institute’s chemistry lab received an upgrade in fall 2016. Margaret Avenue Public School’s library will be renovated. Waterloo-Oxford District Secondary School’s physics room will be expanded. Wilson Public School will receive a double gym. The school has the smallest gym area per student in the region.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News A Message Regarding the Attacks in New Zealand Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders A Message Regarding the Attacks in New Zealand March 15th, 2019 Contents 1SUPPORT & GUIDANCE 1.1Guidance for students 1.2Guidance for elementary student parents/guardians 1.3Guidance for secondary student parents/guardians This morning, we awoke to the news of yet another terrorist attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, that has left 49 people dead and several others wounded. We stand together in grieving this tragedy with our community. This senseless act will impact the thousands of students, staff, families and community members we welcome into our buildings every day in different ways. We are particularly mindful of the effect this event and other actions around the world have on our Muslim students and staff, families and allies. We are a school district for all of Waterloo region, no matter what your background or beliefs. We are committed to ensuring our schools and communities are safe, caring and inclusive spaces where each student, staff member, family and community member feel valued. We want everyone in our schools to experience a deep sense of belonging and acceptance. It is essential that we all pay particular attention to how we greet and connect with each other in the coming days. When our students and staff return to schools on Monday, we will ensure a warm welcome for all and reinforce that our schools are safe places for learning. We must all watch, listen and reach out to individuals who seem troubled and show that we care about them. Support is available for anyone who is feeling vulnerable – at any time. Please encourage anyone who is struggling to seek out that support by talking to a friend, a parent, a teacher or a colleague. I am grateful that we are a community that supports and cares for each other, and that we can lean on one another in times like this. John Bryant, Director of Education SUPPORT & GUIDANCE It can be difficult to know how to respond to events such as those in Christchurch. To help students, parents and staff, we are providing some simple guidelines that you can use to inform your conversations over the coming days. Guidance for students You belong here, and we care about you – each and every one. You are part of a strong school community that comes together when any among us feels afraid or vulnerable. If you need to talk, reach out to a trusted adult at school, home, or in your community. If someone reaches out to you, listen. Pay special attention to how you treat others this week, especially those who may be questioning how they belong. Be kind, be welcoming, and include everyone. Guidance for elementary student parents/guardians People are talking about these events, so recognize that children may become concerned that something bad will happen to them, their family or friends. Explain that safety measures are in place and reassure them that you and other adults will take care of them. If your child is not focused on the events, do not dwell on them. Try to avoid having detailed adult conversations regarding the tragedy in front of children. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. Young children may not be able to express themselves verbally. Pay attention to changes in their behaviour or social interactions. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Young children, in particular, may not be able to distinguish between images on television and their personal reality. Older children may choose to watch the news; be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your children know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner. Guidance for secondary student parents/guardians Bring up the topic at a time and place where a discussion can occur. If there are distractions, a shortage of time or if either you or your teen is too tired or busy, it is likely the conversation will not be completed. If your teen is not focused on the tragedy, do not dwell on it. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. It is normal for people to try to make sense of things when a serious loss occurs. Allow your teen to share his or her ideas and speculations. Help them to separate what they know from what they are guessing about. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Teenagers may choose to watch the news—be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children and teens feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your teen know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner.

Students in the cafeteria became aware of a peer’s Instagram post that included threatening comments. The post was shared widely among our students, causing some panic and miscommunication that a shooting would take place. SJAM students immediately brought the issue to the attention of the administration, and we were able to quickly identify and secure the student responsible for the post. As a result, we did not have to put our school into lockdown or hold and secure. Following our school safety procedures, we called and worked with Waterloo Regional Police right away. I want to make it clear to our families that the Instagram post did not make an explicit threat that a school shooting would take place. The post did contain information that is worrying to staff, and we are investigating the incident with police. Sometimes, experiencing incidents like this can cause students to become anxious or feel uncomfortable. If your child is feeling uneasy and would like to speak with someone, our child and youth worker and guidance staff are available. The safety of students and staff at Sir John A Macdonald is my top priority. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at school. Principal Jennifer Shortreed Read more about Principal’s Message on School Incident – March 5th » Categories: News SJAM Drama Presents – “We Will Never Be the Same” Posted February 26, 2019 Sir John A. Macdonald is proud to announce its production of “We Will Never Be the Same” by Emma Dines, Alan K. Sapp and Daniel Kruger.  The play is inspired by the events and aftermath of the shooting of 10 Amish girls at a Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania schoolhouse in 2006. The play explores the world’s reaction to this hate crime, and the incredible response from the Amish community to extend forgiveness rather than retaliation.  SJAM’s production will seek to learn from this example of forgiveness, and to explore how each person faces and deals with tragedy, each in their own way.

On Monday, June 15, staff presented trustees with an update regarding implementation of the new Health & Physical Education Curriculum. Since 2010, the Ministry has engaged in extensive consultation regarding the revised curriculum for Health & Physical Education, Grades 1-8 and Health & Physical Education, Grades 9-12. On February 23, 2015, the Ministry released both of these curriculum policy documents, which are scheduled for mandatory implementation in September 2015. To prepare for the implementation of the new curriculum in September, a team of WRDSB staff attended in training offered by the Ministry of Education. Staff that participated in the training include: superintendent of education, learning services coordinator, equity and inclusion officer, mental health lead, elementary and secondary principals, and elementary and secondary teachers. Based on the content presented at these sessions, the team is developing training sessions for both elementary and secondary school teachers and administrators, as is typical whenever a revised curriculum policy document is released. Some of this training is scheduled in June 2015 to assist teachers with implementing the revised curriculum in September 2015. Other training components and the development of resources to support teachers will take place during the 2015-16 school year. Looking for more information on the new curriculum? The Ministry of Education has lots of resources available on their website. Some of these resources include: Myths Vs. Facts for the new curriculum Key Messages about the new curriculum Parents’ Guide to the new curriculum I have concerns about my child learning the new curriculum, what can I do? There has been a great deal of confusion about the content of this curriculum, and we encourage you to speak with your child’s teacher, or principal for clarification. Parents/guardians who feel that aspects of the curriculum are in conflict with their faith or religious beliefs should be aware that the WRDSB has both a Faith and Religious Accommodations policy and procedure in place. This helps to foster an inclusive learning environment that promotes acceptance, and respect. Please speak with your principal for more information about this policy. View the Faith & Religious Accommodation Policy and Procedure Is the WRDSB hosting information sessions on the new curriculum? Trustees passed a motion to invite Education Minister Liz Sandals to host information sessions in Waterloo Region this fall. A letter will be sent to Minister Sandals inviting her to the region to provide information to parents. We will keep you updated on the progress of this request as we receive information.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Important Notice for Secondary Students & Families Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Important Notice for Secondary Students & Families October 8th, 2015 Dear Parents/Guardians of Secondary Students: We wanted to provide you with an update about job action being taken by Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (OSSTF) Support Staff, which includes secretaries, custodians and supervision monitors in schools as well as some central staff. Currently, OSSTF Support Staff are in ongoing province-wide labour negotiations with the Government of Ontario and the Ontario Public School Boards Association (OPSBA).  As a result, members of OSSTF Support Staff are taking part in a legal job action that will impact our schools. It’s important to note that this does not include teachers, schools remain open and instructional programs continue to run. During these extraordinary times in our schools, principals and vice-principals are working together with staff to maintain a caring and positive school environment. As always, student safety and learning remain the top priorities of all WRDSB staff, and superintendents are in regular contact with our schools to assess any concerns. Our principals and vice-principals have done, and will continue to do, their very best to maintain school activities and we thank them for their work.  Right now they are being directed to focus on three key areas: Keeping schools open Making sure students and staff are safe Ensuring student learning continues Most of the job action has not had a direct impact on students and families, as principals and vice-principals have taken on additional tasks.  During this job action, however, there may be situations where our usual service may be delayed or limited. We remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached between unions, the Government of Ontario and OPSBA in the very near future.  Please continue to monitor our website at www.wrdsb.ca/labour for updated information as it becomes available.

Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Why were our schools closed Friday? February 23rd, 2015 The WRDSB has put in place a frigid temperature threshold in our severe weather procedure primarily for three reasons related to the safety of our students: 1. According to Environment Canada, at -35C exposed skin can freeze within 10 minutes. Environment Canada indicates that in temperatures between -28 to -39 there is a high risk of exposed skin freezing (frostnip or frostbite). This temperature is very unusual for our region and some students may not have the appropriate clothing to protect themselves. 2. Most students will take longer than 10 minutes to walk to school and the bused students may wait for an extended period of time should any bus be delayed. 3. We are unable to guarantee crossing guard service to our students as individual crossing guards have a right to maintain their safety given that they are exposed for extended periods of time in frigid temperatures. The Education Centre remains open and is fully operational.

Severe weather refers to conditions such as ice, fog, rain, sleet, snow, wind and/or frigid temperatures and wind chills. We consider a frigid temperature to be -35C with wind chill, or colder. The general manager of Student Transportation Services of Waterloo Region (STSWR) will monitor weather and temperatures in the region beginning at 5:30am, using Environment Canada’s wind chill index. If the temperature is forecasted to reach or exceed -35C with wind chill at 7:00am, buses will not operate and schools will be closed. The education centre will be open to those employees who can safely arrive to work. How do we communicate cancellations or closures? Decisions relating to cancellations and closures are made by 6:00am. Any cancellations and closures will be posted on our website and school websites. Information will also be available on our twitter account (@wrdsb). We encourage you to monitor our website and listen to local media for up-to-date cancellation and closures.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Build a credit: Helping students pursue individual pathways to graduation Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Build a credit: Helping students pursue individual pathways to graduation July 25th, 2018 The stakes are always high as secondary school students get close to graduation. Their future educational and work choices depend on completing all of their requirements, so the pressure is on. For some students, that pressure, combined with other factors that make them less sure of success, can make graduation simply a far off shore. And so, “Build a Credit” was born. It’s a flexible and evolving online learning approach and credit earning option for students being pioneered at Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School (SJAM) in Waterloo. And it addresses the shared, strategic determination of both the school and the board to get more students past that graduation goal post. At SJAM, students who have lost their momentum and are struggling to attain needed credits are now being directed to an “alternative path to graduation” that shows real promise says SJAM Principal, Jennifer Shortreed. Technology tools, high engagement content, and a whole new online learning approach is revolutionizing how a few students have moved to within striking distance of their end goal – graduation. “Some students are uncomfortable with traditional classroom settings, or they might have mental health or home issues, or even learning disabilities, that are getting in the way of their success or putting them at risk of dropping out,” says Shortreed, who notes that these difficulties have an impact on attendance as well. “Our new ‘Build A Credit’ approach gives them a way to work independently and online with teacher support and their Chromebooks to cover content required by the provincial curriculum.” Two SJAM students get support from their teachers in the Student Success Centre This spring, 13 students were working diligently, and at various levels, with Student Success teachers at SJAM to design their own courses of study using online tools and resources. They can work from home or in the Student Success Centre at the school. At the outset, the students virtually build their own credit and, working with a teacher, identify online resources that will support their understanding of the core curriculum content. Once the course is set, the student commences their self-directed study, checking in often with their teacher, taking several quizzes and completing an online inquiry assignment. They can work outside the school 100 percent of time, if that is their preference and link into school via phone, FaceTime, email or Google classroom. The students also set their own learning goals and are encouraged to remain accountable for them, even when other distractions and good old-fashioned procrastination threaten their advancement. With hard work, a credit can be completed within a six-week period. “Build a Credit” was exactly what Corben Ekmanis needed. His shyness and anxiety made class time really difficult and he had fallen very far behind when this new learning option became available to him. Clearly delighted with his own progress, Corben is on track to graduate even earlier than planned. He’s completed a number of modules and course credits, and spends every second period, each day, in the SJAM Student Success Room. A world of possibilities has opened up for him and he’s been able to pursue topics that truly interest him, while keeping within the parameters of required study guidelines. Most recently, through an interdisciplinary credit, Corben completed a multi-media inquiry project devoted to how music affects video games, which he embellished with an array of hyperlinks, player input and music he recorded himself. Grade 12 Student, Luke McGill can barely contain himself when talking about his recent experience with “Build a Credit”. He enthusiastically explains that he is now able to pursue more credits per semester and that he actually enjoys the learning process, especially the options to pursue topics of interest and express his own opinions. He says that he is now more confident and self-reliant, and is imagining post-secondary education in a way that never occurred to him before. He has particularly enjoyed learning about his own, personal learning style (and the study skills that go with it) and he has been helping Student Success teacher, Anne Doelman, refine and adjust online learning options at SJAM, providing a critical feedback loop. With a plethora of online and independent learning options to pick from, the Student Success teachers at SJAM believe they have hit upon the missing ingredients and the transformational bridge to gaining credits for their students. “The technology and the pedagogy are finally coming together in a way that had been previously imagined but not realized,” says, Doelman “We’ve learned that teacher support remains key, but we are also seeing the students just take off with their studies. It is sometimes hard to keep up with them!” This new online learning model affords both students and educators a lot of flexibility to build a course of study suited to personalities, content and curriculum requirements. Doelman and her Student Success colleague, Ivanka Rowley, both highlight that they are there to both navigate and negotiate with students so their learning journey stays on track and credits are earned. This learning innovation by SJAM students and teachers got its start last fall when the school hosted a Canadian Student Leadership Conference (CSLC) that involved putting the whole school online for a three-day long learning experiment says Vice-Principal, Sandy Millar. During this time, SJAM teaching staff honed their skills related to building and offering online lessons. “Build a Credit” just took it to the next level. As the school continues to reflect upon and improve the program, Shortreed stresses the importance of remaining innovative and responsive to student needs. “This is messy learning for all, but important work to continue to evaluate and measure against student achievement,” she adds. SJAM will have company in this endeavour as the other 15 high schools in the region will begin collaboration on a blended-learning student success-based program in the 2018-19 school year. For now, every credit earned is a win. And the students and teachers associated with “Build a Credit” will tell you they know what success looks like. by Susan Wright Categories: News « Older: Secondary school summer office hours for 2018 Newer: SLAM welcomes the Waterloo Regional Police Service » Sir John A.

Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News International travel update Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders International travel update March 9th, 2017 The safety and well-being of our students is always our top priority. This priority extends beyond the classroom when our students travel both within Canada and internationally. It is our responsibility to ensure that every possible precaution is taken to ensure the safety of our students and staff when they travel. Considering the recent events in many countries, including Canada, the Waterloo Region District School Board has taken the opportunity to review all student trips to determine if any or all should be postponed or cancelled. After careful review, at this point, we are not cancelling any of our trips. However, we do want to make you aware of some issues. We encourage you to carefully review your individual travel insurance plans should you decide to cancel at any time. Trips to Europe At this point, both Belgium and France are an “elevated” level of risk, according to the Canadian government. The government is advising visitors to “exercise a high degree of caution” due to the “current elevated threat of terrorism.” The Canadian government has not moved to the next level of advising residents to “avoid all non-essential travel.” There are many student trips planned for both countries, most to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Vimy Ridge this year. We have already put additional safety measures in place for these trips and additional precautions are in place by the government and the Vimy Foundation for the celebration. Trips to the United States We have also heard concerns relating to students and staff entering the United States. We continue to monitor this situation and we will be in touch with you if changes to the immigration requirements for the United States require us to do so. International travel is less predictable today than in years past. Please be aware that there could be greater delays at airports, and more time necessary to move through customs and security. It is also imperative to ensure that your child has all their required travel documentation in order and up-to-date. We know that travel can be an enriching and fulfilling experience. As an education system, we have tried to balance this with the need for student and staff safety. We also need to make you aware that global volatility means that we may need to cancel trips, with little notice, should circumstances require it. Thank you for your understanding.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News WRDSB students attend 7th annual Gay-Straight Alliance conference Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders WRDSB students attend 7th annual Gay-Straight Alliance conference February 9th, 2017 On Wednesday, more than 200 energetic students and staff from the Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB) gathered at Bingeman’s for the 7th annual Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) conference, in partnership with KW Counselling‘s OK2BME program. Students from 23 WRDSB schools participated in this one-day conference. Joined by community support groups, the conference provided a space where people could feel safe and accepted, talk about their hopes and fears, and feel a part of a larger family in a world that sometimes can feel so small. “I am so glad we live [in Canada] and we are so accepting,” said one student during the open mic session. Another student, who expressed fear of being themselves outside of their GSA club, said, “I feel safe that I can say who I love and be who I am. I want to thank my GSA family because they are always there for me no matter what.” We're joined by more than 200 #WRDSB staff and students at this year's #GSAconference at @bingemans. It's been an incredible honour to partner with @kwcounselling for 7 years for a day of learning, growth and acceptance. #OK2BME2017 #lgbtq #OK2BME #prideineducation A video posted by Waterloo Region DSB (@wr_dsb) on Feb 8, 2017 at 9:17am PST Peter Rubenschuh, WRDSB superintendent of student achievement and well-being, opened the event with a message of hope, success and continued acceptance to our rainbow community on behalf of the director of education and senior team. “As a society, we need to continue working towards treating others with respect, care and love because each person’s story is different – it’s what makes our board unique and special,” said Rubenschuh. “Each and every student and staff member brings a certain spark to our system and there shouldn’t be discrimination of any kind towards that, it should be celebrated. The WRDSB encourages everyone to be themselves and this annual conference is a step in the right direction.” #DYK: Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) is a safe space for #LGBTQ students and their allies to support each other and work against heterosexism. #OK2BME2017 📸 #WRPS SRO Stephen Churm A photo posted by Waterloo Region DSB (@wr_dsb) on Feb 8, 2017 at 10:14am PST Attendees participated in various workshops, listened to keynote speakers, and had the opportunity to gather information from a number of the community booths that were set up. “I would like to thank the Waterloo Regional Police Services, KW Counselling, and other community partners for lending their time and being a part of this significant event,” said John Bryant, WRDSB director of education. “This event shows that our students have established a safe space for LGBTQ students, staff, and their allies to support each other and work against heterosexism.” The WRDSB has 31 GSA clubs operating in our elementary and all secondary schools. If your school doesn’t have a GSA club, visit the OK2BME website and start one today.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Flag at Half Mast to Honour Victims of Orlando Shooting Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Flag at Half Mast to Honour Victims of Orlando Shooting June 17th, 2016 The Waterloo Region District School Board is profoundly saddened by the recent tragedy in Orlando, Florida. The loss of 49 lives to this hate motivated crime that specifically targeted the LGBTQ+ community highlights the importance of our collective efforts in eliminating discrimination, elevating our commitment to protecting human rights and working towards safe and healthier communities. As a large educational system and educational community, we are affected by this tragic event in many ways. We are especially mindful of the impact this event has on LGBTQ students and staff, families and allies. On Thursday, June 16, a pride flag will be raised to half-mast at the Education Centre in a ceremony that will include a moment of silence.  The raising of the flag is to symbolize our acceptance and inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community.  The flag will continue to fly for the month of June.  Canada’s first-ever Pride Month was launched on June 1, 2016. SJAM and many other WRDSB schools have also lowered our flags to half mast this week to honour the lives lost the past weekend.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends who were impacted by this tragic event.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Category: News Principal’s Message on School Incident – March 5th Posted March 5, 2019 Dear Sir John A Macdonald families, I am writing to make you aware of an incident that happened today during our lunch hour. Students in the cafeteria became aware of a peer’s Instagram post that included threatening comments. The post was shared widely among our students, causing some panic and miscommunication that a shooting would take place. SJAM students immediately brought the issue to the attention of the administration, and we were able to quickly identify and secure the student responsible for the post. As a result, we did not have to put our school into lockdown or hold and secure. Following our school safety procedures, we called and worked with Waterloo Regional Police right away. I want to make it clear to our families that the Instagram post did not make an explicit threat that a school shooting would take place. The post did contain information that is worrying to staff, and we are investigating the incident with police. Sometimes, experiencing incidents like this can cause students to become anxious or feel uncomfortable. If your child is feeling uneasy and would like to speak with someone, our child and youth worker and guidance staff are available. The safety of students and staff at Sir John A Macdonald is my top priority. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at school.

Macdonald is proud to announce its production of “We Will Never Be the Same” by Emma Dines, Alan K. Sapp and Daniel Kruger.  The play is inspired by the events and aftermath of the shooting of 10 Amish girls at a Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania schoolhouse in 2006. The play explores the world’s reaction to this hate crime, and the incredible response from the Amish community to extend forgiveness rather than retaliation.  SJAM’s production will seek to learn from this example of forgiveness, and to explore how each person faces and deals with tragedy, each in their own way.

March 11th, 2015 A huge congratulations goes out to our 2015 senior boys’ basketball team for an incredible season! First, they claimed the WCSSAA crown with a resounding win over CHCI. Then they dominated CWOSSA to take the 2015 title. This past week, the team competed at AAAA OFSAA in Windsor. Seated 8th provincially, our Highlanders opened the tournament with a decisive win over St. Anne, then pulled off an amazing comeback to beat a tough squad from Vaughan. This put our team in the quarter-finals vs. the #1 ranked team in the province – St. Michael’s College from Toronto. The boys put forth a great effort against a very strong team, but ultimately fell to St. Mike’s 69-43.  This marks the best season ever by SJAM Senior Boys’ Basketball!  Fantastic accomplishment by the players and coaching staff!

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Principal’s Message on School Incident – March 5th Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Principal’s Message on School Incident – March 5th March 5th, 2019 Dear Sir John A Macdonald families, I am writing to make you aware of an incident that happened today during our lunch hour. Students in the cafeteria became aware of a peer’s Instagram post that included threatening comments. The post was shared widely among our students, causing some panic and miscommunication that a shooting would take place. SJAM students immediately brought the issue to the attention of the administration, and we were able to quickly identify and secure the student responsible for the post. As a result, we did not have to put our school into lockdown or hold and secure. Following our school safety procedures, we called and worked with Waterloo Regional Police right away. I want to make it clear to our families that the Instagram post did not make an explicit threat that a school shooting would take place. The post did contain information that is worrying to staff, and we are investigating the incident with police. Sometimes, experiencing incidents like this can cause students to become anxious or feel uncomfortable. If your child is feeling uneasy and would like to speak with someone, our child and youth worker and guidance staff are available. The safety of students and staff at Sir John A Macdonald is my top priority. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at school.

Macdonald is proud to announce its production of “We Will Never Be the Same” by Emma Dines, Alan K. Sapp and Daniel Kruger.  The play is inspired by the events and aftermath of the shooting of 10 Amish girls at a Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania schoolhouse in 2006. The play explores the world’s reaction to this hate crime, and the incredible response from the Amish community to extend forgiveness rather than retaliation.  SJAM’s production will seek to learn from this example of forgiveness, and to explore how each person faces and deals with tragedy, each in their own way.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Pink Shirt Day is February 27 Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Pink Shirt Day is February 27 February 24th, 2019 On Wednesday, February 27, join us in recognizing Pink Shirt Day. This is a day to stand up against bullying. Pink Shirt Day is on Wednesday, February 27, 2019. This movement was inspired by the actions of two high school students from Nova Scotia. In 2007, the students witnessed a Grade 9 boy being bullied for wearing a pink polo shirt on his first day of school. Bullies harassed the boy, called him a homosexual for wearing pink and threatened to beat him up. Disgusted with this treatment, the students went to a nearby discount store and bought 50 pink shirts. Then they went online to email classmates to get them on board with their anti-bullying cause that they dubbed a “sea of pink”. The next day not only were dozens of students outfitted with the discount tees, but hundreds of students showed up wearing their own pink clothes, some head-to-toe. Pink Shirt Day has grown across Canada as a way to symbolize that we as a society will not tolerate bullying. Wear pink to show your support. Students wearing pink shirts at Clemens Mill Public School. Source: @missroltsclass. Having our students experience a caring learning environment that addresses their well-being is important to us. Research shows that a positive and welcoming school environment is essential to the physical and mental wellness and success of each and every one of our students. We understand that families are looking for support and resources for children who may be experiencing acts of bullying, which is why we have created sections on our website that includes bullying prevention and intervention information, what a positive school climate looks like, and the process for addressing concerns if you believe your child is being bullied. How can I participate in #PinkShirtDay? Participating is just as simple as wearing pink in your hair, as a piece of clothing, or as a cool accessory. We invite you to follow us on Twitter or Instagram to join the larger anti-bullying conversation. If you are planning to wear pink on Wednesday, please help us spread the word that bullying is not tolerated by tweeting or sharing a picture using the hashtag #WRDSBpink and #PinkShirtDay. Sample social media posts: I am participating in #PinkShirtDay with #WRDSBpink. #WRDSBpink pledge: I do not, and will not, stand for bullying of any kind. #PinkShirtDay I wear #WRDSBpink today to show that I do not tolerate bullying. #PinkShirtDay Choose to be kind, not just on #PinkShirtDay, but every day. Together, let’s stand up to bullies. #WRDSBpink Categories: News « Older: Take our annual budget survey Newer: Feb 25: Buses cancelled, schools are open » Sir John A.

February 29th, 2016 What a banner year for SJAM’s boys’ basketball teams!  Dual WCSSAA championships last week were just the beginning.  This past weekend, both teams put in amazing performances at CWOSSA at WCI and SJAM. On Saturday afternoon, the juniors battled St. Mary’s in the finals and struggled early.  Falling behind by as much as 17 points, the team drained 6 3-pointers in a row to chip away at the lead and pull ahead in the 4th quarter.  In front of a hyped home-town crowd, the juniors posted an incredible come-from-behind victory! The seniors took the court immediately after, riding a wave of excitement and a string of dominant victories during the tournament.  Facing off against cross-town rivals WCI, SJAM pulled ahead early and never looked back as they charged towards their second consecutive CWOSSA title.  The senior Highlanders now head to Windsor March 7th to 9th for their second trip to OFSAA in as many years.  Best of luck!

The month of June is Pride Month. Many of our students, parents/caregivers, staff and community members identify as members of the Rainbow (or LGBTQ+) community. “Our schools are safe spaces for everyone that walks through the front doors and we’ll continue to create inclusive, safe spaces, and ensure the well-being of all students and staff,” said John Bryant, director of education. “Raising the Pride flag demonstrates our commitment to supporting all of our students, staff, parents, caregivers and community members.” Staff will raise the Pride flag at the Education Centre, located at 51 Ardelt Ave. in Kitchener, at 9 a.m. on Thursday, June 1. We’re joined by more than 200 #WRDSB staff and students at this year’s #GSAconference at @bingemans. It’s been an incredible honour to partner with @kwcounselling for 7 years for a day of learning, growth and acceptance. #OK2BME2017 #lgbtq #OK2BME #prideineducation A post shared by Waterloo Region DSB (@wr_dsb) on Feb 8, 2017 at 9:17am PST   “Flying the Pride flag aligns with the board’s Operational Goal of student and staff well-being, and serves as a visual reminder that staff and students experience a sense of belonging in a caring learning environment,” said Bryant. The Waterloo Region District School Board recognizes that providing students with an opportunity to learn and develop in a safe, caring and respectful society is a shared responsibility in which the Board and schools play an important role. The WRDSB has 31 GSA clubs operating in our elementary and all secondary schools. If your school doesn’t have a GSA club, visit the OK2BME website and start one today. OK2BME is a local organization that provides counselling and support to LGBTQ+ youth and their families. Stay connected. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. We encourage students, staff and community members to share on social media, using #WRDSBpride.   Categories: News « Older: SJAM Senior Drama Showcase Newer: Pre-Exam Canine Stress Relief Comes to SJAM » Sir John A.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Director responds to recent terror attack in Quebec Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Director responds to recent terror attack in Quebec January 31st, 2017 Contents 1Guidance for students 2Guidance for elementary student parents 3Guidance for secondary student parents On Monday morning, Canadians woke to news of an attack on a mosque in Quebec City that left six people dead, and several others wounded. The Prime Minister called the attack an “act of terror against Canada and all Canadians.” This deplorable act will have an effect on the thousands of students, parents and staff we welcome to our buildings every day in different ways. We are particularly mindful of the effect this event and other actions around the world have on Muslim students and staff, families and allies. We are a school district for all of Waterloo region, no matter what your background or beliefs. We are committed to ensuring our schools and communities are safe, caring and inclusive, where each and every student, staff person, family and community member knows that they are valued. We want everyone in our schools to experience a deep sense of belonging and acceptance. While we are not aware of any specific local safety concerns, we know that racism and hate know no borders. Once racist thoughts and values attach themselves to our hearts and minds they are free to spread and negatively impact the lives of others. It is important that we all pay special attention to how we greet and connect with one another this week. We all share the responsibility to ensure a warm welcome for all and that our schools are safe places for compassion and learning. We must all watch, listen and reach out to individuals who seem troubled and show that you care about them. We have lowered flags across our district to show our communities that we stand together in grieving the events that unfolded in Quebec. Support is available for anyone who is feeling vulnerable – at any time. Please encourage anyone who is struggling to seek out that support by talking to a friend, a parent, a teacher or a colleague. I am grateful that we are a community that supports and cares for each other, and that we can lean on one another in times like this. John Bryant Director of Education PARENT LETTER – ARABIC VERSION It can be difficult to know how to respond to events such as those in Quebec City. To help students, parents and staff we are providing some simple guidelines that you can use to inform your conversations over the coming days. Guidance for students You belong here and we care about you – each and every one. You are part of a strong school community that comes together when any among us feels afraid or vulnerable. If you need to talk, reach out to a trusted adult at school, home, or in your community. If someone reaches out to you, listen. Pay special attention to how you treat others this week, especially those who may be questioning how they belong. Be kind, be welcoming, include everyone, show every day what it means to be Canadian. Guidance for elementary student parents People are talking about the events of the weekend, so recognize that children may become concerned that something bad will happen to them, their family or friends. Explain that safety measures are in place and reassure them that you and other adults will take care of them. If your child is not focused on the events, do not dwell on them. Try to avoid having detailed adult conversations regarding the tragedy in front of children. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. Young children may not be able to express themselves verbally. Pay attention to changes in their behaviour or social interactions. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Young children, in particular, may not be able to distinguish between images on television and their personal reality. Older children may choose to watch the news; be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your children know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner. Guidance for secondary student parents Bring up the topic at a time and place where a discussion can occur. If there are distractions, a shortage of time or if either you or your teen is too tired or busy, it is likely the conversation will not be completed. If your teen is not focused on the tragedy, do not dwell on it. However, be available to answer questions to the best of your ability. It is normal for people to try to make sense of things when a serious loss occurs. Allow your teen to share his or her ideas and speculations. Help them to separate what they know from what they are guessing about. Limit exposure to media coverage. Images of a disaster or crisis can become overwhelming, especially if watched repetitively. Teenagers may choose to watch the news—be available to discuss what they see and to help put it into perspective. Maintain normal family routines as much as possible. Routine family activities, classes and friends can help children and teens feel more secure. Be aware of your own needs. Don’t ignore your own feelings of anxiety, grief and anger. Talking to friends, family members, faith leaders and mental health counsellors can help. Let your teen know you are sad. You will be better able to support them if you can express your own emotions in a productive manner.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Important Notice for Secondary Students & Families Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Important Notice for Secondary Students & Families April 21st, 2015 Potential job action by Waterloo Region District School Board secondary teachers. The purpose of this letter is to update Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB) families on the status of labour negotiations with its secondary teachers. We know that, as parents, it’s important for you to know how this situation may affect your daughter and/or son. Our concern is with the safety, success and well-­‐being of our students. We want you to clearly understand the status of our schools if there is a full withdrawal of services in WRDSB secondary schools. We want to make sure families have as much notice as possible. The Ontario Labour Relations Act requires the receipt of a No Board Report before the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation can announce legal strike action. As per the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, school boards must be given five days’ notice before any strike action can be taken. As such, the earliest WRDSB secondary teachers may be on strike is May 4, 2015. Similar job action is being taken in six other school boards across Ontario—Durham, Halton, Lakehead, Ottawa-­‐Carleton, Peel, and Rainbow Districts. If a full withdrawal of services occurs, all WRDSB secondary schools will be closed to students. This means: All instructional programs for grade 9 to 12 students will be cancelled.   Extracurricular activities, field trips and school events will be cancelled. Buses for secondary students will not operate.   Buses will continue their routes for elementary students only. Teachers may be picketing outside Waterloo Region District School Board secondary schools and the Education Centre. Picketing is not expected to take place outside our elementary schools. If you have questions, or want to know what is happening in Waterloo Region District School Board schools related to negotiations: Look for updates on social media—follow @WRDSB on Twitter. Visit the Waterloo Region District School Board website at www.wrdsb.ca/labour. Visit your local WRDSB secondary school website.   Our priority during any job action is the safety and well-­‐being of our students. We will continue to monitor the situation and its impact on Waterloo Region District School Board students. We are committed to keeping you informed and will update www.wrdsb.ca/labour and communicate with you directly, as the situation changes. As a board, we respect our secondary teachers and value their work with students. We remain committed to reaching fair, negotiated agreements with all of our employee groups. Thank you for your patience, support and understanding.

One way for us to find out how best to do this is to ask students in Grades 3-11, staff and parents/guardians how they feel about their school and interactions with teachers and other students. Each year, we conduct a Safe, Caring and Inclusive School (SCIS) Survey for students, staff and parents/guardians to complete during April and May. This year, the survey will be available online from April 3 to May 31, 2017. The survey includes questions about teaching and learning, relationships, safety, and school environment. The purpose of the survey is to: Provide us with information about the experiences of our students, staff and families; Provide us with information to help with decisions to expand programs and/or provide resources to help students from all cultures, faith groups and learning exceptionalities, and; Ensure that we continue to support safe, caring and inclusive environments. The survey for parents and guardians can be completed online and should take no more than 30 minutes to complete. The survey is anonymous, and you can choose to skip any question or stop participating in the survey at any time. Results from the surveys will be used to provide reports for our schools that will help us plan or revise our SCIS initiatives. Take the survey About Safe, Caring and Inclusive Schools The Waterloo Region District School Board recognizes that providing students with an opportunity to learn and develop in a safe, caring and respectful society is a shared responsibility in which the Board and schools play an important role. Schools that have a variety of prevention and intervention strategies foster a positive learning and teaching environment that supports academic achievement for all students and helps students reach their full potential.

In November, we asked our community to help us define in a single statement what the Waterloo Region District School Board is all about. Over the last year, a big team of dedicated and passionate people in Waterloo region worked together to set a new direction for our public schools with a new strategic plan. We asked our community to help finish that process and craft a phrase that defines this innovative school district. More than 2,500 community members, students, parents and staff voted online and our Facebook and Twitter posts reached nearly half a million people with more than 12,000 comments, likes and shares of our #WeAreWRDSB campaign. Echoing our region’s world-class reputation for new ideas, world-class education and innovation, our community picked: Innovating tomorrow by educating today The words of our new purpose statement give us a beacon to guide our efforts. The statement isn’t simply words on a page. In fact, our system lives this vision day in, day out. Like Helmut Tinnes, principal of Doon Public School, who is creating innovative ways of sharing school announcements by video using budding elementary school reporters. Or Jake White, who despite dropping out from Southwood Secondary School, is defining a new future for himself with the help of our U-Turn program. These stories and more are shared in this annual report. And we have many more inspirational stories to come. Our priorities and commitments Innovating tomorrow by educating today is the last part of our new strategic plan that includes three priorities – each with associated outcomes – that guide the work of this board in delivering first class public education to Waterloo region. The plan also includes a series of commitments to which our organization is dedicated. Strategic priorities Our students are first – each and every one Our staff, families and caregivers are partners in every student’s learning journey Our culture of innovation builds students’ confidence and success as they face the future Commitments We, as individuals who serve public education in Waterloo Region, are committed to: Service Integrity Respect Innovation Collaboration What’s next? You can read in more depth about some of the programs and stories from across our board that are helping us to put our strategic plan into action in the Director’s Annual Report. We have exciting plans to share more stories and examples of our strategic plan coming to life over the next year. We’re launching a brand-new Instagram channel to share inspiration and examples of #WeAreWRDSB education and innovation. We encourage you to share stories and pictures from this report on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and continue to use #WeAreWRDSB to show our community how we are nurturing tomorrow’s innovators in our schools. If you have kids – talk to them about what innovation means to them and how today’s education will set them up to be Waterloo’s latest innovation generation.

Over the last year, a team of dedicated and passionate people in Waterloo region worked together to set a new direction for our public schools with a new strategic plan. In November, we asked our community to help finish that process and craft a phrase that defines our school district. You picked “Innovating tomorrow by educating today”. Now, we want to share with you and hear your feedback about our plan to educate the innovation generation. At 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, February 21, 2017, we’re inviting all members of our community to hear from John Bryant about our new strategic plan and from senior team members on our operational goals. You’ll have the opportunity to talk directly with education leaders about mathematics, graduation rates, student well-being and much more. Space is limited, so register now for the opportunity to talk innovation in Waterloo region education with school leaders. Date: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 Time: 5:30 p.m.-7:30 p.m. (Doors open at 5:15 p.m. and networking and light refreshments will be available until 8 p.m.) Location: Education Centre, 51 Ardelt Avenue, Kitchener, ON N2C 2R5 (Map) The evening includes addresses from John Bryant, WRDSB’s director of education, Scott McMillan, chair of the Board of Trustees, an hour-long carousel session with superintendents and an opportunity to talk one-on-one with our most senior leaders and trustees. For more information, please contact us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or by email.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Students play, teachers learn during May 5 PD Day Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Students play, teachers learn during May 5 PD Day May 11th, 2017 While students were away from the classroom on Friday, May 5, more than 1,000 secondary teachers hit local movie theatres—to learn. District 24-Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF) members participated in a TED talk-inspired session, delivered by their colleagues and community members as part of a day of learning on a range of topics. During his Human Curriculum talk, Bob Kline, teacher at Huron Heights Secondary School, reinforced the idea that teachers can demand excellence and have fun at the same time. “Powerful and personal connections with students encourage learning on a daily basis,” he said. Each session was unique and provided timely information for staff to use in their schools on a daily basis. “Over the last year, opioid-related incidents have gone from 20 per month to two per day,” said Sloden Lackovic, staff sergeant with Waterloo Regional Police Services. “People are unaware of the Fentanyl crisis and we need to educate about the dangers.” A quote displayed during Look Deeper Than a Smile presentation. A teacher from Waterloo Collegiate Institute presented Look Deeper Than a Smile, which was an autobiographical presentation on the presenter’s personal journey with depression. She explained what it is like to with depression, along with some of the personal struggles that our students may have to deal with on a daily basis. Each morning session touched on the importance of student and staff well-being, whether it was cognitive, emotional, mental or physical. The morning sessions included: The world is your classroom: Pack your bags and go travel! – The presenter shared how travel has molded them into the teacher they have become. The Fentanyl crisis – An overview of how the opioid crisis has developed, current trends, facts and dangers associated with the drug, presented by a Waterloo Regional Police Services’ staff sergeant. What I’ve learned from you: The human curriculum and contemporary teaching – Fostering a positive school culture through storytelling. Look deeper than a smile – The presenter shared their journey with depression and the struggles kids may be dealing with on a daily basis. Education reform for dummies – The presenter allowed teachers the chance to consider new ways to deliver the curriculum. Safe spaces to brave places – Using theatre, acting and improve techniques, the presenter shows how teachers can create powerful, positive spaces in any classroom. Understanding your digital footprint – The presenter showed teachers how to embrace the use of social media, how to use it effectively and how to control your digital footprint. During the afternoon, staffs picked from one of 30 subject-specific workshops, run by the Education Services Department of Provincial OSSTF and Waterloo District School Board Subject Associations. Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario—Waterloo Region members spent the morning working on assessment, planning and collaboration activities. In the afternoon, members attended a workshop on creativity, hosted by musician David Usher. Professional development opportunities were offered to designated Early Childhood Educators, and Educational Assistants and Child and Youth Workers, at their home schools. Stay connected.

Trustee Mitchell took her seat at the board table in 2001 as a representative for Cambridge and North Dumfries. During 16 years as a trustee, she served as Chairperson from 2007-2008 and as Interim Chair in 2012. She served as Vice-Chair from 2005-2006. Upon her election as Chair at the Inaugural Board meeting in 2007, Trustee Mitchell emphasized her commitment to the Waterloo Region District School Board and public education. “Excellence in education will require a steadfast and dedicated approach. As Chairperson of this Board, I shall support our board in our collective goals and responsibilities of stewards of public education.” Her colleagues around the board table echoed her commitment to public education. “I am very proud of my colleague’s long service and accomplishments. Regardless of the circumstances, she always managed to provide efficient and effective service to all supporters of public education,” said Trustee Mike Ramsay. Trustee John Hendry said he was sad to hear the news of her decision to step down. She served the people of Cambridge and Region of Waterloo with class and dignity. “Andrea was a vocal supporter of maintaining arts programs, particularly music in our schools,” he said. “I wish Andrea the very best; it was truly an honour serving with her.” “Andrea has devoted a good portion of her life to education and students. Her professional life was a teacher for the WRDSB, and in her retirement, she was elected to represent the people of Cambridge,” said Trustee Kathi Smith. “Andrea approached her work with care, humour and dedication. She will be very much missed by her constituents and by the WRDSB.” During her time as Chair, Trustee Mitchell officially opened Williamsburg and J.W.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News SJAM Response to Weekend Events Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders SJAM Response to Weekend Events January 30th, 2017 Principal’s Remarks: SJAM Cares I would like to address and reassure the SJAM community in the wake of a troubled weekend in Canada and the United States.   I would like to echo the sentiments expressed by our Prime Minister in condemning the attack on Muslims in a place of worship on Sunday evening. The staff and students at SJAM will mourn the victims and hope for a quick recovery for the wounded. This attack, combined with the immigration policy enacted in the United States in the past week, have resulted in challenging times for our diverse community. It is worth emphasizing at this time of tragedy that the SJAM staff would like to do everything we can to support our students in their feeling of safety.  School is a place where we can come together from a wide variety of backgrounds to learn together in an environment of belonging and acceptance.  This weekend’s events remind us that there is much work to be done to fully achieve this vision.  I believe, with the help of our students, our dedicated staff, and our community, that here at SJAM we can work together to achieve this vision. Together we are strong and hopeful. The Exam schedule makes this a difficult time for us to connect with all of our students.  Thus, through this message, I would like to remind you that our Guidance and support staff can be reached at the school this week if any SJAM student is in need of support. Please call us at 519-880-9979 during regular business hours and we will find someone to assist.   Sincerely, Jennifer Shortreed Principal SJAM Categories: News « Older: Rescheduled meeting for Ministry’s well-being strategy Newer: Innovating tomorrow by educating today » Sir John A.

The purpose of the Safe, Caring and Inclusive School Survey is to: provide information to the Board about the experiences of our students, staff and families, provide information to the Board to assist with decisions to expand programs and/or provide resources to help students from all cultures, faith groups and learning exceptionalities, and ensure that the Board continues to support learning in safe, caring and inclusive environments.

We know that this is an exciting and busy time for our staff, students and families. I would like to take a moment to reflect, express gratitude and celebrate the hard work and accomplishments of our school communities. Our strategic priorities and commitments are the foundation of our efforts to help each and every student experience equitable, safe and inclusive learning environments, as well as caring and nurturing relationships, through the professional practice of our educators and staff. Our goal is to support our students to ultimately graduate or reach their chosen destination of success.    We are encouraged by the EQAO results we saw in September which suggest we are making improvements. We have also seen positive outcomes with the re-engagement of students and early intervention for students at-risk of not graduating. We know that there is still more work to be done and are actively implementing strategies to help us reach our goals. We cannot do this work alone. Our staff, families, and caregivers are partners in every student’s learning journey. Together, we are creating the best possible outcomes for our students. So let us celebrate this milestone of another successful school year. I want to thank our families for helping us put our students first – each and every one. Our students’ achievements and well-being are a shared responsibility, and we share in their success. This is only possible through the support of our families. We have been encouraged by the feedback and input we have received from through our family survey, Director’s Town Hall and a variety of focus groups held across our community. Your input is essential to our success. I also want to thank our staff. We are fortunate to have so many dedicated and talented professionals working in a variety of functions inside and outside of our classrooms. The great work of our teachers, support staff, system leaders and departments nurture and support our students to reach their potential. To our students who are starting university, college, an apprenticeship or entering the workforce, I wish you ongoing success as you continue your learning in your new endeavours. To all of our students returning this fall, I hope you have the opportunity over the summer to reflect and recharge. I look forward to our continued work together and welcoming you back in September.

These threats have been issued by persons leaving behind inappropriate messages in a variety of school locations and on social media. These threats have been used to inspire a feeling of unease and fear. The unfortunate decision by individuals to deliberately harass and intimidate others is an abuse of social media and an erosion of personal safety and trust. We want to reassure you that the security of the students and staff is the top priority of all schools, each and every day. Waterloo Region District School Board and Waterloo Regional Police Service are working together to investigate these threats and keep our schools safe, caring and inclusive spaces to learn and work. All schools in the Waterloo Region District School Board are aware of these threats and are taking them into account as they go through their daily routines, including monitoring access to their sites and following security and emergency response protocols to safeguard our school communities. At this time, we have no reason to believe that any of these threats are credible. However, we will continue to work together and monitor individual situations as they arise. No matter the intention, we take any intimidation or threat of violence seriously and the authors of these threats need to understand that they will be held accountable. As we identify the individuals, or groups of individuals, responsible for these threatening remarks, they are subject to consequences and progressive discipline that may result in:    arrest and criminal charges and;    suspension or expulsion from school Our students have the right to learn in a safe environment without fear. Students are encouraged to speak with a trusted adult including a teacher, Educational Assistants, Child and Youth Worker, school administration or a school Guidance Counsellor regarding their concerns. We would ask that parents, guardians and caregivers have a conversation with their child(ren) to discuss the impact of these actions on their school community and the anxiety this creates for others. Students should be reminded that inappropriate behaviour will not be taken lightly and a school disciplinary and criminal response will be taken. If parents, guardians or students become aware of a threat, they should contact the police and inform their school principal immediately. You can also report information related to these threats to Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-8477. Please be assured that every precaution is being taken to ensure the safety of students and staff. We thank you for your continued diligence and support.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why – Guidance for Parents Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why – Guidance for Parents May 4th, 2017 Netflix recently released the series 13 Reasons Why based on the popular young adult novel of the same name by Jay Asher. The series depicts the story of a high school student who dies by suicide, leaving behind 13 cassette recordings that share the events that she perceives led to her death. Series like this one can lead to misconceptions and misinformation about suicide, and possibly to the glorification of suicide. For these reasons, mental health professionals, including the Waterloo Region District School Board’s mental health team, feel it is necessary to make you aware of this series. The WRDSB is providing the following tips, distributed by School Mental Health (SMH) ASSIST and National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), to help with conversations you may have with your child: Encourage critical thinking and remind them that the series is fictional and includes many unrealistic elements. Remind them that it is normal to experience periods of stress and distress and there are healthy coping strategies (e.g. exercise, talking to friends). Model self-care and healthy coping strategies to your child. Let them know that school counsellors are professionals and trustworthy and that their depiction in the series was not accurate. Talk openly about emotional distress and suicide. Doing so, does not make someone more suicidal. If they exhibit any warning signs, such as direct and indirect suicide threats, giving away prized possessions, preoccupation with death in conversation, writing and drawing, changes in behavior, appearance/hygiene, thoughts and/or feelings, and emotional distress, do not be afraid to ask if they have thought about suicide or if someone is hurting them. Ask your child if they think any of their friends or classmates exhibit warning signs. Talk with them about how to seek help for their friend or classmate. Guide them on how to respond when they see or hear any of the warning signs. Listen to your child’s comments without judgment. Doing so requires that you fully concentrate, understand, respond and remember what is being said. Remind them to always seek support if they need it from family members, counsellors, coaches, teachers, or a crisis line like Kids Help Phone, 1-800-668-6868. If the concern is more urgent call Front Door Mental Health, 519-749-2932, Here 24/7 – Addictions, Mental Health and Crisis Services, 1-844-437-3247, take your child to a hospital emergency department or call 911. “We recommend that you ask your child if they have heard or seen the series 13 Reasons Why. If your child insists on watching the series, we encourage them to watch with parents and caregivers. This will provide an opportunity to discuss the show and their thoughts,” says Peter Rubenschuh, superintendent of student achievement and well-being.  “We will continue to do everything we can to support student mental health and well-being.” If students raise questions about the series, WRDSB staff will address the content in ways that are sensitive and appropriate, especially with our most vulnerable students. For additional information, visit Preventing Youth Suicide Brief Facts and Preventing Youth Suicide: Tips or Parents and Educators. As always, if you have individual concerns about your child related to mental health, or need additional resources, please contact your child’s school.

The purpose of the survey is to: Provide us with information about the experiences of our students, staff and families; Provide us with information to help with decisions to expand programs and/or provide resources to help students from all cultures, faith groups and learning exceptionalities, and; Ensure that we continue to support safe, caring and inclusive environments. The survey for parents and guardians can be completed online and should take no more than 30 minutes to complete. The survey is anonymous, and you can choose to skip any question or stop participating in the survey at any time. Results from the surveys will be used to provide reports for our schools that will help us plan or revise our SCIS initiatives. Take the survey About Safe, Caring and Inclusive Schools The Waterloo Region District School Board recognizes that providing students with an opportunity to learn and develop in a safe, caring and respectful society is a shared responsibility in which the Board and schools play an important role.

Student well-being is one of four connected goals in the province’s renewed vision for education – Achieving Excellence. Students with a sense of well-being thrive and overcome challenges in education and in life. The Ministry recognizes that it needs to help students build the knowledge and skills associated with positive well-being. In addition, we have also identified student and staff well-being as an operational goal for the 2016-17 school year. Each of our schools will be focusing on an aspect of student well-being this year as part of the school improvement planning process. The Ministry of Education is looking to develop a shared vision of how we can best support the well-being of all students. This work is being done through engagement with parents and caregivers, students, educators, administrators, social workers, community members and more. PIC, with the help of the Waterloo Region Assembly of Public School Councils (WRAPSC) is hosting an engagement session for parents and caregivers to discuss student well-being. The session will be held on Thursday, February 16, 2017 from 7-9 pm at the Education Centre, located at 51 Ardelt Avenue, Kitchener. The session will take place in the Cambridge Room, to the left of the main entrance. All parents, guardians and caregivers of students in the WRDSB are invited to attend. Please note that childcare will not be provided. Register for the event If you are unable to attend the session but would still like to provide your feedback, there are several options available: Send your feedback to PIC and WRAPSC; it will be included in the feedback sent to the Ministry. Please email wrapsc@gmail.com by February 15, 2017. Submit your feedback online directly to the Ministry by March 19, 2017 Host your own engagement session. This can be done through a school council, community organization or an informal group. Materials needed to organize a session can be found on the Ministry website. Feedback must be submitted by January 15, 2017 We hope you are able to take advantage of this opportunity to provide feedback to the Ministry of Education. If you have any questions about this engagement session or relating to the Ministry’s project in general, please email wrapsc@gmail.com.

This is a day to raise awareness and continue the conversation around mental health. One in five Canadians will suffer from mental illness at some point in their lifetime. A big hurdle for anyone living with mental illness is overcoming the stigma and a major reason why those suffering do not seek help. #BellLetsTalk logo. We want to encourage the conversation and help end the stigma. Having our students experience a caring learning environment that addresses their well-being is important to us. We recognize and appreciate the relationship between student mental health and academic success. We also understand that many families are looking for support and resources for children who may be struggling with anxiety. The WRDSB has developed a Caregivers Guide to Accessing Support for Students With Anxiety to help. “Remember: No emotion is ever final.” An example of the #BellLetsTalk conversation bubble. It can be hard to speak with our children about mental health because it is not always easy to know the right things to say. Check out our online mental health and well-being resources for tips on getting the conversation started and how to access support for your child. How can I participate in #BellLetsTalk? Participating is as simple as tweeting, just once. We invite you to follow and tag us on Twitter to join the larger conversation. Bell will donate 5 cents to support a variety of mental health programs in Canada each time the #BellLetsTalk hashtag is used and retweeted. Sample Draft Tweets: I am participating in #BellLetsTalk Day with @wrdsb. Mental health matters to me and I want to be the change that helps #EndTheStigma with #BellLetsTalk. Uniting with @wrdsb. I am a person my family and friends can talk to when they need support. #BellLetsTalk Need support? If you or someone you know is struggling with their #mentalhealth, please contact @ConnexOntario, a 24-hour mental health helpline 1-866-531-2600. Or, if support is needed immediately, call 911. You’re not alone. It’s okay to reach out for help! #BellLetsTalk Together, let’s help end the mental health stigma for our students, friends, loved ones, and everyone else around us.

A review of community feedback during budget June 7th, 2017 Waterloo Region District School Board continues to work hard with students, staff, parents and caregivers, and community partners, to ensure education and student success is a partnership. This is why we called on you to participate in our annual budget survey, from February 21 to March 10, and provide input on the funding priorities and what is important for the WRDSB community. “Staff strive to prepare and plan for each school year, but we can’t do it alone. As we innovate tomorrow by educating today, families and community members play a major role in the process,” said John Bryant, director of education. “I’d like to thank individuals who took the time to participate in our annual budget survey, and help strengthen the learning that happens at school, each day.” A total of 962 individuals. including staff, students, parents, caregivers and community members, filled out the budget survey. The results are in and we would like to share the highlights with you as the Board of Trustees head into the budget process in June. More than 962 individuals completed the survey and the areas of focus for budget planning, include: Respondents felt that classroom resources, professional development for teachers and online math resources were essential to supporting high levels of student achievement in the area of mathematics. Respondents felt that early identification and intervention of at-risk learners, literacy and numeracy supports, cooperative education, and alternative programming were essential resources/programs to support more students in graduating from secondary school. Respondents provided key themes and suggestions, which included: Additional classroom supports (class sizes, promote best practices amongst teachers), continued wellness support for students, school condition improvements and energy efficiency. “As representatives of the community, we have a sense of what’s important to them. However, having this annual feedback during budget conversations helps guide us through the process,” said Scott McMillan, chair of the board. “Education is a partnership. This feedback is important to all trustees to ensure we plan successfully for another school year.” WRDSB is funded by the Ministry of Education and is governed by legislative and contractual obligations that we must adhere to, such as class sizes and staffing levels. “From a business perspective, community members play a critical role in helping us shape our budget and guiding us as a board, while adhering to ministry requirements,” said Matthew Gerard, coordinating superintendent of business services and treasurer of the board. The results of the survey will be shared with our Board of Trustees during the budget process in June. Once the budget is approved by the Board of Trustees, details will be shared on www.wrdsb.ca.

Back in 2011, Bell started a campaign leveraging the popularity of social media. Over the years, it has grown to be internationally recognized with more than $79 million being donated to Canadian mental health initiatives and organizations. WRDSB senior team participating in #BellLetsTalk. Participating is as simple as posting or tweeting, ‘I am participating in #BellLetsTalk Day,’ or ‘Mental health matters to me and I want to be the change that helps #EndTheStigma with #BellLetsTalk,’ just once. We know most people are on social media, so you have the power to help break down the mental health barriers. Each time the #BellLetsTalk hashtag is used or shared on Twitter or Instagram on January 25, Bell will donate $0.05 cents to various mental health programs. Mental health touches each and every one of us, whether it is a student or teacher at school, a coworker, a friend or a loved one. The money raised by this one day event will make a massive difference in the lives of people who need it most. You personally don’t have to donate any money to this, just your time. Today, we ask you to join us on Facebook and Twitter by tweeting, posting, sharing or retweeting what is shared on our various social media channels or participate in your own way. Bell Let’s Talk has great resources on their website. One idea is to download and print the Bell Let’s Talk conversation bubble and write or draw what mental health means to you, or provide words of encouragement that you think people need to hear, and share it. Our hope is that you encourage others around you to also join the online conversation. Together, we have the power to help end the mental health stigma for our students, friends, loved ones, and everyone else around us. For more information about resources available to students, please visit our mental health and well-being resource page.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Educational Assistant and Child & Youth Worker Appreciation Day Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Educational Assistant and Child & Youth Worker Appreciation Day January 18th, 2019 Today marks the second annual Educational Assistant and Child & Youth Worker Appreciation Day at the Waterloo Region District School Board. Educational Assistants (EA) help to deliver educational programs in our schools, while Child Youth Workers (CYW) are mental health professionals who work with troubled children who face a variety of emotional, behavioural or physical problems. Today, we recognize the key role EAs and CYWs play in maintaining safe and productive workplaces and learning environments. The EA and CYW enable students whose issues would preclude inclusion to be part of the typical student body. This not only benefits the individual student but the entire student body as it teaches everyone the values of inclusion, acceptance and adaptation. This work doesn’t go unnoticed, as Lynn Schulze, head of the ESL Department at Waterloo Collegiate Institute, explained. EAs are, on paper, hired to assist with the academic part of class, but to her, this is not an adequate description of their true value. “The EAs have the tough task of following the highest needs kids around for most of the day. While teachers may teach these challenging students for, maybe one period a day, EAs often spend more time with them than their own parents or host families do,” said Schulze. The dedication and patience exemplified by EAs and CYWs are what stands out most to Schulze. It would be hard to imagine a day of school without their efforts. “EAs and CYWs are crucial in helping every student feel successful and included in their school,” John Bryant, Director of Education, explained. He feels it’s important to recognize the role they play in our schools. “I am happy to take time to recognize the important role EAs and CYWs play every day in our schools. Teachers, parents and students will all tell you that every student’s experience is improved by the hard work that is done by EAs and CYWs in our Board.” We encourage you to join the community and WRDSB in marking your appreciation for this important group of staff. If you’d like to join in sharing your thanks on social media, use the hashtag #EACYWAppreciationDay.

On Saturday afternoon, the juniors battled St. Mary’s in the finals and struggled early.  Falling behind by as much as 17 points, the team drained 6 3-pointers in a row to chip away at the lead and pull ahead in the 4th quarter.  In front of a hyped home-town crowd, the juniors posted an incredible come-from-behind victory! The seniors took the court immediately after, riding a wave of excitement and a string of dominant victories during the tournament.  Facing off against cross-town rivals WCI, SJAM pulled ahead early and never looked back as they charged towards their second consecutive CWOSSA title.  The senior Highlanders now head to Windsor March 7th to 9th for their second trip to OFSAA in as many years.  Best of luck!

When families and schools work together to address the physical symptoms, worrying thoughts and avoidance associated with anxiety, we can teach students to face challenging and sometimes fearful situations with success and confidence. The Caregivers’ Guide will help parents and guardians to recognize signs their child may be struggling with anxiety, while also providing resources to help them succeed. This includes a variety of home-based strategies, as well as apps and online support for families of a student with anxiety. The guide also outlines tiers of support available to students in school, depending on their level of need. This can range from consultations with guidance counsellors to the creation of an Individual Education Plan (IEP). Documentation is required in order for your child to access appropriate supports at the Targeted and Indicated level. The more detailed the documentation, the better informed our school team will be in putting together a support plan for your child.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Board appoints new Cambridge trustee Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Board appoints new Cambridge trustee June 7th, 2017 At a special meeting of the board tonight, Waterloo Region District School Board trustees chose Courtney Waterfall, a Cambridge resident, as its newest member. Trustee Courtney Waterfall Trustees voted Waterfall to office as trustee for Cambridge and North Dumfries after Trustee Andrea Mitchell retired in March. Trustee Waterfall will serve on the board until the end of the current board term in 2018. “I am excited to work with this great team of trustees to make a difference for education in Waterloo region,” said Trustee Waterfall. “I was inspired to apply to be a trustee as my three children go to school here in the region, but I also want to be a voice for all of the students of our great region.” Nine candidates from across Waterloo region each gave a five-minute address to current trustees, on a topic of their choosing. Candidates talked about physical education, the WRDSB strategic plan and operational goals and their individual experiences in the district. Trustee Waterfall highlighted the importance of student well-being in her bid to become a trustee. “The mental and physical health of our students go hand-in-hand to create their well-being and ultimately help them achieve success – whatever that may be,” she said. Trustee Waterfall takes her seat at the board table after signing the oath of office with Scott McMillan, chair of the board of trustees, and John Bryant, Director of Education. Current trustees applauded as Waterfall signed the oath of allegiance and took her seat at the board table. She will start her duties at the Committee of the Whole meeting on Monday, June 12, 2017. “I am delighted to welcome Trustee Waterfall to Waterloo Region District School Board,” said Scott McMillan, chair of the board of trustees. “I am confident that Courtney’s experience on our Parent Involvement Committee and school councils will help her as this board seeks to innovate tomorrow with a first-class public education today.” Trustee Waterfall has been a member of school councils for six years and has supported the Parent Involvement Committee and Waterloo Region Assembly of Public School Councils. Her three children attend elementary schools across WRDSB. She lives in Cambridge and attended Galt Collegiate Institute. Stay connected. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Children’s Mental Health Week Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Children’s Mental Health Week May 7th, 2018 May 7 – 13th marks Children’s Mental Health Week across Ontario. This is an important week where we are able to bring awareness to the prevalence of mental health issues and the need to support our kids’ mental health. Wear It Wednesday To show support and raise awareness of children’s mental health, the Canadian Mental Health Association Waterloo Wellington is inviting everyone in our community to wear green on Wednesday, May 9. The #WearItWednesday campaign is about taking mental health advocacy and making it visible—wearing green and sharing it on social media reminds our community that it’s important to talk about mental health. Supporting mental health and well-being We know that mental wellness is a condition for learning. There is a clear relationship between student mental health problems and academic difficulties. When we attend to student wellness in our schools, students have a greater opportunity to reach their academic and social emotional potential. We have supports in place to help students and caregivers. Who can I talk to at school regarding my child’s mental health concerns? You may find it helpful to speak to your child’s teacher. The school Principal or guidance department (in secondary schools) is always a good place to go for help too. They will connect you with other resources you may need. Each school has access to a designated school social worker and psychologist through a referral process that happens at the school. We also have parent resources available on our website to learn more about mental health and well-being. If you are worried about your child’s mental health, or that of someone else, be sure to ask for help from your family doctor or health care professional.  Categories: News « Older: SJAM’s Online Newspaper – The Piper Newer: Sun Safety » Sir John A.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why – Guidance for Parents Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why – Guidance for Parents May 4th, 2017 Frequently Asked Questions – 13 Reasons Why, provided by School Mental Health ASSIST – May 4, 2017 Netflix recently released the series 13 Reasons Why based on the popular young adult novel of the same name by Jay Asher. The series depicts the story of a high school student who dies by suicide, leaving behind 13 cassette recordings that share the events that she perceives led to her death. Series like this one can lead to misconceptions and misinformation about suicide, and possibly to the glorification of suicide. For these reasons, mental health professionals, including the Waterloo Region District School Board’s mental health team, feel it is necessary to make you aware of this series. The WRDSB is providing the following tips, distributed by School Mental Health (SMH) ASSIST and National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), to help with conversations you may have with your child: Encourage critical thinking and remind them that the series is fictional and includes many unrealistic elements. Remind them that it is normal to experience periods of stress and distress and there are healthy coping strategies (e.g. exercise, talking to friends). Model self-care and healthy coping strategies to your child. Let them know that school counsellors are professionals and trustworthy and that their depiction in the series was not accurate. Talk openly about emotional distress and suicide. Doing so, does not make someone more suicidal. If they exhibit any warning signs, such as direct and indirect suicide threats, giving away prized possessions, preoccupation with death in conversation, writing and drawing, changes in behavior, appearance/hygiene, thoughts and/or feelings, and emotional distress, do not be afraid to ask if they have thought about suicide or if someone is hurting them. Ask your child if they think any of their friends or classmates exhibit warning signs. Talk with them about how to seek help for their friend or classmate. Guide them on how to respond when they see or hear any of the warning signs. Listen to your child’s comments without judgment. Doing so requires that you fully concentrate, understand, respond and remember what is being said. Remind them to always seek support if they need it from family members, counsellors, coaches, teachers, or a crisis line like Kids Help Phone, 1-800-668-6868. If the concern is more urgent call Front Door Mental Health, 519-749-2932, Here 24/7 – Addictions, Mental Health and Crisis Services, 1-844-437-3247, take your child to a hospital emergency department or call 911. “We recommend that you ask your child if they have heard or seen the series 13 Reasons Why. If your child insists on watching the series, we encourage them to watch with parents and caregivers. This will provide an opportunity to discuss the show and their thoughts,” said Peter Rubenschuh, superintendent of student achievement and well-being.  “We will continue to do everything we can to support student mental health and well-being.” If students raise questions about the series, WRDSB staff will address the content in ways that are sensitive and appropriate, especially with our most vulnerable students. For additional information, visit Preventing Youth Suicide Brief Facts and Preventing Youth Suicide: Tips or Parents and Educators. As always, if you have individual concerns about your child related to mental health, or need additional resources, please contact your child’s school.

Many institutions and organizations fly the Pride flag as a celebration of diversity. During the month of June, all Waterloo Region District School Board locations will fly the Pride flag alongside the Canadian flag. We believe that our schools are safe spaces for everyone that walks through our doors. Many of our students, parents, caregivers, staff and community members identify as LGBTQ+. Our strategic plan emphasises that the well-being for all of our students and staff are met through a focus on equity and inclusion. Raising the Pride flag demonstrates this commitment to our students, staff, parents, caregivers and community members. About the Pride Flag Rainbow flags are flown on federal, provincial and municipal sites, as well as police headquarters and educational institutions all across the country. Its colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet represent life, healing, sunlight, nature, harmony and spirit. The Pride flag is a celebration of diversity and a visual reminder that WRDSB welcomes and supports each and every student – regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. Before making the decision to fly the Pride flag, we checked in with the Government of Canada’s flag protocol lead at Heritage Canada. They confirmed that where schools only have one mast it is an acceptable workaround to show our support and inclusion of LGBTQ+ by flying the Canadian flag first, with the Pride flag beneath. Showing our support for LGBTQ+ does not diminish our respect for our Nation’s flag. We have put together some resources and videos to help answer questions and guide conversations parents and guardians may be having with their children. Help us celebrate Pride month. You can share your stories and pictures with us on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #WRDSBpride.

Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Sun Safety Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Sun Safety May 8th, 2018 It may have taken longer than expected, but spring has finally arrived in Waterloo region. We know that many parents and students are excited to get outdoors and enjoy the gorgeous weather. But before we head outside, our friends at the Region of Waterloo want to remind us of some important sun safety tips to keep in mind. Sun protection is very important because it can limit the risk of sun damage and skin cancer. You can reduce the risk to yourself and your family by taking the following steps: Take precautions During peak periods and on high UV days take precautions such as: wearing a wide-brimmed hat wearing protective and loose clothing wearing sunglasses applying sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher with both UVA/B protection (Do not put sunscreen on babies under six months old) Limit time in the sun Even if you are wearing sunscreen it is important to avoid spending a long time in the sun during peak UV periods (11 a.m. to 4 p.m., April to September). Children should never stay in the sun for long periods, even when wearing sunscreen.  Plan your outdoor events early or late in the day to avoid the midday sun. Find shade Look for a shady spot when you are outside. Also, keep babies under one year of age out of direct sunlight. We have identified creating shaded spaces in our school yards and play areas as a key component of our Sun Safety and Shading Policy. Either natural shade created by trees or constructed shade provides relief from the sun. When possible, constructing shaded areas are taken into consideration when we build new schools or additions. We review our other school sites often to make sure enough shade is available to our students. Be aware of the UV Index There is considerable change in the UV index from day to day. When the rating goes above moderate, it is often included in weather forecasts.  UV Index Sun Protection Actions 0-2 Low Minimal sun protection required.

You are welcome to invite others to join in this evening of learning and of standing together against hatred and discrimination Please RSVP to jeff_chard@wrdsb.ca if you’d like to attend.

Successful learning relies on strong partnerships between school, home and community. Our staff work hard to ensure students achieve success through a variety of programs and resources that meet the needs of each student. Our ongoing commitment is to ensure the learning, achievement and well-being of all our students. In addition to our focus on learning, we are excited to implement our new Strategic Plan for 2016. This plan will help guide, set priorities and desired outcomes for the WRDSB for the next 3-5 years.  Throughout the year we will be engaging with our school communities to establish our ‘purpose statement.’ It is our hope that you will be able to see yourself, your child, and your school community reflected in our Strategic Plan. School Councils, the Waterloo Region Assembly of Public School Councils (WRAPSC) and the Parent Involvement Committee (PIC) are integral parts of our education system. These committees advise on issues related to student success and parent engagement. Participating in your child’s learning is a key factor in their education. We encourage you to become involved and visit www.wrdsb.ca/pic for helpful resources and supports. We believe that our students are first – each and every one. Our staff, families and caregivers are partners in every student’s learning journey, and our culture of innovation builds students’ confidence and success as they face the future. We are excited for this new school year to begin and we wish you and your child a successful year ahead.

The loss of 49 lives to this hate motivated crime that specifically targeted the LGBTQ+ community highlights the importance of our collective efforts in eliminating discrimination, elevating our commitment to protecting human rights and working towards safe and healthier communities. As a large educational system and educational community, we are affected by this tragic event in many ways. We are especially mindful of the impact this event has on LGBTQ students and staff, families and allies. On Thursday, June 16, a pride flag will be raised to half-mast at the Education Centre in a ceremony that will include a moment of silence. The raising of the flag is to symbolize our acceptance and inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community. The flag will continue to fly for the month of June.

What are some local resources I can contact that provide support and services to families and children that identify as LGBTQ+? For the month of June, all WRDSB schools and the education centre are flying the Pride flag. Below are some frequently asked questions and resources to help guide conversations for parents and caregivers. Why is my child’s school flying the Pride flag? The month of June is Pride month. Many of our students, staff, parents/guardians and community members identify as members of the Rainbow or LGBTQ+ community. Flying the Pride flag not only signals that our schools are safe spaces for everyone, it also aligns with our Operational Goal of student and staff well-being and our new Strategic Priority that staff are supported in their wellness and students experience a sense of belonging in a caring learning environment that addresses their well-being. Our school district is showing our acceptance of the LGBTQ community during Pride month by raising the Pride flag. We continue to raise awareness and support inclusion and acceptance of other marginalized groups in other ways. Some examples include developing an anti-racism guide for elementary teachers, supporting persons with disabilities by making our schools more accessible and creating a new board statement that acknowledges the territorial lands of the Haudenosaunee, Anishnawbe, and Neutral People. We continue to work to ensure the equity and inclusion of all our students and staff. What if the flying of the Pride flag is against my personal values and beliefs? We believe that our schools are safe spaces for everyone. Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. Regardless of your personal values and beliefs, we must follow the Ontario Human Rights Code that protects marginalized groups from discrimination and harassment. We are flying the Pride flag to demonstrate our commitment to our community that discrimination and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated in our schools. Are you allowed to fly another flag on the same mast as the Canadian flag? The Government of Canada indicates that the manner in which the Canadian flag is displayed in Canada is not governed by legislation. The rules applied by the government are not mandatory for individuals or organizations, they simply serve as guidelines. Before making the decision to fly the pride flag, we checked in with the Government of Canada’s flag protocol lead at Heritage Canada. They confirmed that where schools only have one mast it is a pragmatic workaround to show our support and inclusion of the rainbow community by flying the Canadian flag first, with the pride flag beneath. What does LGBTQ+ mean? LGBTQ+ refers to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer or Questioning. The + refers to people who identify as Intersex, Asexual or an Ally. Other common terms used to describe people in these communities who do not identify as heterosexual are the Queer Community or Rainbow Community. It is important to be respectful and use the terms that people prefer when identifying a person as part of this community. Please see this glossary of terms as a reference. How are schools discussing the Pride flag and LGBTQ+ issues? Each of our schools is committed to providing its students with a positive school climate. We know that when students feel safe and supported in a healthy school climate, they have greater success. Through the work of our Safe, Caring and Inclusive School (SCIS) Teams as well as the province’s Well-Being strategy we are committed to creating the healthy, positive spaces in schools that our students need. Each of our high schools and 15 elementary schools have Gay Straight Alliances (GSA). These clubs are safe spaces for our students, staff, and allies of the Rainbow community to come together and discuss issues they may be facing and topics that matter to them. Our GSAs are places that our students feel comfortable being themselves and can have open and honest conversations with their peers. In our elementary schools, through the Health and Physical Education curriculum, students learn to understand and respect things that are the same and different from each other. This includes that not every family looks the same. Some families have a mom and a dad, some just have a mom or a dad and some families have two moms and two dads. What are supports available to students in schools? Are staff members prepared to have discussions with students regarding LGBTQ+ issues? In addition to our schools having a GSA as a safe space and resource for students, our administrators and teachers have access to resources that we developed in partnership with local agencies. These resources include an LGBTQ OutLoud videos and resource guide, developed in partnership with OK2BME. The video and guide provides support around LGBTQ issues on different topics with facilitation questions designed to help guide conversations with staff and students. This year we introduced Administrative Procedure 1235 – Accommodation of persons who identify as transgender. Each of our administrators participated in a full day of learning about the new procedure and what it means to identify as trans. Last March, physical education teachers and school administrators participated in training sessions on the revised Health and Physical Education Curriculum, including information on how to discuss sexuality and gender identity. How do I talk to my child about what it means to identify as gay or transgender? Since everyone parents in different ways, it is difficult for us to answer this question. You will know best on how to speak to your child about accepting and including people who identify as LGBTQ. For elementary aged children, we suggest focussing your discussion on love and relationships and explain that people love each other in different ways. When talking to children about people who identify as transgender, explain that in their head and their heart, they feel that they are a boy or a girl. Sometimes it takes a person more time to be comfortable to express themselves as who they really are. We recommend the following books to help guide your conversations: Molly’s Family by Nancy Garden George by Alex Gino And Tango Makes Three by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell King and King by Linda de Haan My Princess Boy by Cheryl Kilodavis These books can be found in many of our school libraries as well as our local public libraries. Our school staff are available for parents who wish to discuss these issues and parents can email info@wrdsb.on.ca if they would appreciate more support from our equity and inclusion team. The Human Rights Campaign in the United States has a guide for parents on discussing LGBTQ+ issues with students. The visibility of the Pride flag has started conversations at home. What are some local resources I can contact that provide support and services to families and children that identify as LGBTQ+? OK2BME is a local organization that supports students who identify as LGBTQ+ and their families. OK2BME is a program available through KW Counselling and can be reached at 519-884-0000 or by email at ok2bme@kwcounselling.com Categories: News « Older: Have your say in the 2017-18 school year budget Newer: Summer school transportation schedules now available » Sir John A.

Waterloo Fire responded to the alarm and determined that there was no threat of fire and students were allowed to reenter the school. There was some minor flooding in the cafeteria from the sprinkler system. The cafeteria remained off-limits to students this morning while staff cleaned up the water. Thank you to our custodial staff, with support from our facilities department, who had our cafeteria cleaned up quickly and available to students this afternoon. We want to thank our Highlander staff and students for evacuating the school quickly and remaining calm during the alarm and for Waterloo Fire for keeping our school community safe.

This tragedy undoubtedly has had an impact on the students, parents and staff we welcome to our buildings every day. We are particularly mindful of the affect this event, and other actions around the world have had on Jewish students and staff, families and allies. As an expression of sympathy and support for the community of Pittsburgh and the broader Jewish faith community, flags at the Education Centre and WRDSB schools will fly at half-mast. The impact of an attack like this can be difficult for many and bring up strong feelings of stress and anxiety. If you are struggling with this recent news, please know that we have many supports available in our schools for you to connect to.  Your teachers, guidance counsellors, CYWs, social worker and other staff can assist – reach out if needed.

We believe in promoting sun safety through education and working with our community partners, such as Public Health. Creating shaded spaces in our school yards and play areas is a key component of our Sun Safety and Shading Policy. Either natural shade created by trees or constructed shade provides relief from the sun. When possible, constructing shaded areas are taken into consideration when building new schools or additions. We review our other school sites often to make sure enough shade is available to our students. When spending time outside and the UV index is 3 or higher, Public Health recommends using a combination of sun protection. These include wearing clothing to cover exposed skin, using sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and avoiding peak sun time from 11am-4pm. Below is some information on the UV Index and more tips on staying sun safe from our partners at Public Health. The UV Index UV Index Sun Protection Actions 0-2 Low Minimal sun protection required. If outside more than one hour, wear sunglasses and sunscreen. reflections can nearly double UV strength. 3-5 Moderate Take precautions. Cover up, wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen if outside for 30 minutes or more. Look for shade near midday. 6-7 High Protection required. UV damages skin and can cause sunburn. reduce time in the sun between 11 am and 4 pm. Seek shade, cover up, wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. 8-10 Very High Extra protection required.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News October 5 is World Teachers’ Day Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders October 5 is World Teachers’ Day October 4th, 2018 On October 5th, we celebrate World Teachers’ Day, a day where we acknowledge the dedication and passion of our educators. This morning, 64,000 students across Waterloo Region made their way to school. They walked with their friends, rode their bikes, or boarded a school bus. They entered classrooms excited and ready to learn. In each classroom, our incredible teachers have lessons prepared, smiles on their faces, and are ready to start the day. They are the foundation of education. World Teachers’ Day is a day devoted to showing our appreciation for educators around the world. The theme for this year, “The right to education means the right to a qualified teacher” was developed by UNESCO in order to remind us all that the right to an education is not possible without qualified teachers. It is an opportunity to reflect on the critical role each educator holds. The teachers in our district explore many professional learning opportunities throughout the year, expand their knowledge, support our strategic plan, and acquire new skills that benefit the learning outcomes of their students. On their own time, they organize clubs that support students’ interests and coach teams which foster good sportsmanship and build important life skills. But most importantly, they create safe, equitable and inclusive learning environments where students can succeed and reach their potential. I would like to wish all of our teachers and educators a Happy World Teachers’ Day. You provide value and enrichment to our students, our community, and our future. Thank you for all you do as you lead the way for our students – each and every one. John Bryant Director of Education Waterloo Region District School Board To celebrate World Teachers’ Day, we talked to our students. See what they had to say about what makes a great teacher.

Posted February 29, 2016 What a banner year for SJAM’s boys’ basketball teams!  Dual WCSSAA championships last week were just the beginning.  This past weekend, both teams put in amazing performances at CWOSSA at WCI and SJAM. On Saturday afternoon, the juniors battled St. Mary’s in the finals and struggled early.  Falling behind by as much as 17 points, the team drained 6 3-pointers in a row to chip away at the lead and pull ahead in the 4th quarter.  In front of a hyped home-town crowd, the juniors posted an incredible come-from-behind victory! The seniors took the court immediately after, riding a wave of excitement and a string of dominant victories during the tournament.  Facing off against cross-town rivals WCI, SJAM pulled ahead early and never looked back as they charged towards their second consecutive CWOSSA title.  The senior Highlanders now head to Windsor March 7th to 9th for their second trip to OFSAA in as many years.  Best of luck!

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News WRDSB observes Orange Shirt Day on September 28 Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders WRDSB observes Orange Shirt Day on September 28 September 23rd, 2018 Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB) recognizes Orange Shirt Day as a way to honour residential school survivors, those who did not survive, and their descendants. It’s just one of the ways we support, educate and reconcile our relationship with Indigenous people. What is Orange Shirt Day? Orange Shirt Day is observed each September 30 and was first launched in 2013. The origin of Orange Shirt Day is based on Phyllis Webstad’s story of entering an Indian Residential School in 1973 and having her new orange shirt removed from her and replaced with a school uniform. Her experience of having her orange shirt being taken from her is symbolic of all that was taken from Indigenous peoples as a result of Indian Residential Schools and is the reason we wear orange on September 30. For well over a century, Indian Residential Schools were used as a tool to assimilate Indigenous peoples into the dominant Canadian culture. Established in 1892 by the Canadian government, in partnership with churches, Indigenous children were often moved long distances from their families and lived at the schools. Once at school, Indigenous children were forbidden to speak their languages nor practice their cultures and traditions. Living conditions for students in Indian Residential Schools were often harsh and there was often significant emotional, physical and sexual abuse of the students. WRDSB Orange Shirt Day Activities Since September 30 falls on a Sunday in 2018, WRDSB will acknowledge Orange Shirt Day on Friday, September 28, 2018. Please tag images of how you are honouring Orange Shirt Day by mentioning @wrdsb on Twitter or @wr_dsb on Instagram and using the hashtag #IndigenousWRDSB.

This year’s theme will be ALLIES. Allies use their energy and power to call out inequity and amplify the voices of people who share their own lived experiences of inequity. Allyship takes place on a spectrum from one-on-one conversations to leading movements. Participants are asked to consider how we can all be advocates for equity. Through poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction, we welcome students reflections on the past and your hopes, dreams, and directions for the future. When gender equity is connected to the dream of equality for everyone, how is our world made better? Your stories are a part of the Waterloo landscape — today and tomorrow. In what ways are you #HeForShe? The University will award a $500 prize for the top submission in each category (poetry, creative non-fiction, and fiction). Selected submissions will also be included in a special University of Waterloo anthology on gender equity that will be published on March 8, 2019 – International Women’s Day. The youth category winners will also be invited to attend the University’s International Women’s Day dinner with a parent or teacher. Submission guidelines Submissions for WRDSB students are due by October 12, 2018. Eligibility requirements: Contest is open to all WRDSB students in Grades 9-12. Submissions must not have been previously published in any other forum, whether print or online. However, pieces that were previously submitted as part of school work will be accepted. Entrants must consent to the publication of their work, whether in print or online. Entrants must consent to editing of their work for grammar and typos, as needed. Content and genre requirements: Submissions must fall into one of three broad categories: fiction, creative non-fiction, or poetry. The 2018-19 contest theme is allies. Participants are asked to consider how we can all be advocates for equity. Gender includes all genders, including two-spirit, transgender and non-binary people. Formatting requirements: Entrants may submit more than one entry, but each entry must be no longer than 5000 words. Submissions must be received in Google Doc, .doc, .docx, or .pdf format. Submissions should be emailed to heforshe@wrdsb.ca Submissions must include a word count at the end of the document. Fiction and creative non-fiction submissions should be double-spaced. If a poem moves on to a second page, indicate stanza breaks with a backslash (/), as needed. If submission is more than one page, include page numbers.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Annual School Councils’ Report shows community engagement in our schools Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Annual School Councils’ Report shows community engagement in our schools November 15th, 2016 The 2015-16 Annual School Councils’ Report was presented at the Committee of the Whole meeting on Monday, November 14th. Every school council submits their own report to the Waterloo Region District School Board near the end of the school year. The report outlines their engagement with the needs and desires of their own school community. School Councils serve as an important tool to provide feedback and input into our schools and their surrounding communities. They provide a forum in which parents and caregivers, along with community partners, can interact with school administration and teachers leading to improved school environments, increased resources for student achievement, and the fostering of community involvement and giving. Each school is unique, but common themes emerge which reveal an interesting reflection of the concerns of our larger organization. An exciting point of interest from this year is a focus on technology in the classroom, with elementary school council’s providing funding for over 65 Chromebooks, as well as over 35 iPads. Funds were also used to subsidize school trips, classroom supplies, home reading programs and extracurricular clubs. Councils also showed the importance of reaching outside of their own schools by spearheading programs for holiday toy drives, refugee welcome supplies and many other initiatives. School councils often help to organize and pay for special events, extending learning experiences outside of the classroom. Family game nights, art, math and science events, guest artists, performers and educational speakers are all wonderful examples of what councils help to provide schools. MacKenzie King Public School’s council helped to run an “Inquiring Minds Exhibition” where students initiated a project of inquiry based on their own interests, that they completed with their parents. These were displayed for all students and families to enjoy. Eastwood Collegiate Institute’s (ECI) Council aided in bringing the second annual Human Library event to fruition, which included 18 human “books” and students, parents and community members widely attended. Often councils set long term goals, and it is very rewarding to be able to congratulate them when these goals are achieved. Empire Public School council obtained their three-year fundraising goal of $65,000 for a natural year-round playground, providing an imaginative outdoor space for both learning and leisure. Many councils echoed similar goals and initiatives to improve green space and outdoor play areas Student and family wellness were a major point of interest for the majority of councils. Workshops addressing personal health, anxiety, resiliency, online safety, nutrition and more permeated the reports. One particularly creative example of this was Grand River Collegiate Institute’s (GRCI) initiative towards stress management during exams. Council provided stress-busting activities such as bracelet making, colouring, connect the dots, volleyball, therapy dogs, bubble wrap popping stations, study tips video and workshops, as well as greater access to computer labs after school to help with workload. These are just a few of the examples of the amazing work that is accomplished through the support of School Councils, and we are proud to have such dedicated parents and caregivers as partners in our school communities.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Changes to WiFi access: go WRDSB Secure to maintain access Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Changes to WiFi access: go WRDSB Secure to maintain access November 21st, 2016 Contents 1Why are we introducing these changes? 2How to maintain your access 3Supervision and digital citizenship On January 3, 2017, WRDSB is introducing changes to the filtering of internet content on our password-free wireless network, WRDSB Wireless. These changes mean that if you continue to connect using WRDSB Wireless you will no longer be able to access some popular websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Vimeo. You can continue to access the same sites as today – on any device – by logging in to the WRDSB Secure wireless network using your WRDSB login and password. Follow the easy steps to make the switch to WRDSB Secure today. Why are we introducing these changes? Over the course of the past year, parents and community members raised concerns regarding the effectiveness of our internet content filters. In the course of that debate, we identified a common goal: we all want to ensure that our students stay safe online and that this school district has practices that encourage student development as safe digital citizens, able to navigate the internet and use technology in ways that support their learning and well-being and that prepare them for a world where pervasive, open access to the Internet is a reality. Although our existing firewall/filter protection denies access to millions of undesirable sites, we know that the protection is imperfect and that students and/or community members indicate that they can access inappropriate content from time to time.   For this reason, we have elected to provide an even greater assurance on the levels of protection by implementing a graduated filtering approach that will require user or device identification before they can access our network. This change will take effect on January 3, 2017. Access to a login-free WiFi network will continue with extremely limited access to the internet after this date. How to maintain your access For everyone with a PAL username and password, the sites you can visit will not change if you make the switch to WRDSB Secure – a fully encrypted network. All WRDSB shared devices will be pre-configured to use this network. Staff and students using personal devices or Chromebooks can use this network and the good news is that login is automatic after the first use. Device-specific instructions are available. Supervision and digital citizenship We all want to ensure that our students stay safe online – and this means more than simply applying internet filtering controls. Adult supervision of student access and use of technology continues to play an important role in ensuring online safety and in cultivating digital citizenship. All staff who work with students, are encouraged to understand, consider and implement the following best practises for teachers and classrooms (adapted from The Association of Library Consultants and Coordinators of Ontario): Familiarize yourself with the WRDSB’s Responsible Use Procedure (RUP) and connect these guidelines to your own practice. Understand and manage your classroom online activities, empowering students to manage their own digital footprints in order to protect their privacy and safety. Model responsible use of technology to help students learn to how to become responsible digital citizens. Make relationships between character education and digital citizenship so that these values can be applied to various situations. Encourage effective strategies to search for information (e.g., keywords, narrowing a search) and the use of credible online resources (e.g., databases, encyclopedias, ebooks). Observe and monitor students as they use board technology or personal devices to ensure they access appropriate sources (i.e., sites, videos, images). Be aware of copyright guidelines for Canadian educators and teach information skills of ethical use and attribution (citation) of sources. Integrate social networking technology (i.e., Twitter, blogging, YouTube, etc.) as instructional, research and communication tools to model constructive use. Regularly review and follow terms of service regarding parental permission and age restrictions for online tools. Refer to the IS-09-L-E and IS-09-L-S forms that are to be kept in the school office when posting student photos to the web or social media in accordance with Administrative Procedure 1090. More information and resources are available online.  Categories: News « Older: SJAM Welcomes CSLC 2017 Next September Newer: Semester 1 Midterm Report Cards – Thursday, Nov. 24th » Sir John A.

Applications are now open for college and university programs with the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP). The last date for university applications is January 11, 2017. College applications for the fall term should be submitted before February 1, 2017. As part of the most significant reform of student assistance in Noth America, the government of Ontario is removing the financial barriers to attending college or university. If a family income is under $50,000, tuition is covered. Even if a family income is higher, the new OSAP is still there to help with generous grants that will make attending college or university more affordable. The Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development has launched a new online calculator to help students and families find out quickly and easily whether they qualify for free tuition or other grants and supports from the province.

We need your ideas, whether you are a student, a parent, a grandparent, a teacher, a bank clerk or a bus driver. We want to hear from everyone. And it’s an important job. We want you to help us define in a single statement what the Waterloo Region District School Board is all about. Over the last year, a team of dedicated and passionate people in Waterloo region have worked together to set a new direction for our public schools with a new strategic plan. Now is the time to finish that process and craft a phrase that defines what this innovative school district is all about. We’re calling this statement our purpose statement. What is a purpose statement? Simply put – a purpose statement is our reason for being. It’s meant to take the detailed work of our strategic plan and translate it into a clear, short statement that energizes and inspires our community These aren’t words that will get lost on the About Us page of our website – but words that everyone in our system can live by and see themselves reflected. The Harvard Business Review describes a purpose statement as the philosophical heartbeat of an organization: “It says, ‘This is what we’re doing for someone else.’ And it’s motivational, because it connects with the heart as well as the head.” How can you help? We’ve launched a brand new website and we’re asking you to vote on the top four ideas that students from all 16 of our secondary schools helped to create in early November. We gave student senators our staff’s best ideas, some background on our plan and then some freedom to get creative. Students in Waterloo region are a talented bunch and they came up with many creative ideas – and here are their best: Innovating tomorrow by educating today. Educating the innovation generation. We learn. We care. We innovate. We are WRDSB. Innovate and inspire lifelong learning. All that’s left to do now is to vote on your favourite. And if none of these work for you, tweet ideas to @wrdsb using the hashtag #WeAreWRDSB.  What’s next?

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News UPDATED: Advisory on school trips overseas Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders UPDATED: Advisory on school trips overseas November 28th, 2016 Contents 1Update: Monday, November 28, 2016 1.1Additional safety considerations 1.2Cancellation information 2Update: Monday, November 21, 2016 3Update: Monday, November 14, 2016 4Friday, November 11, 2016 Update: Monday, November 28, 2016 The WRDSB has concluded its review of the decision to cancel scheduled trips to Belgium and France.  Our decision-making in this process has reflected our desire to assure the safety and security of every traveler. As part of our review we considered information from a range of sources including: Veterans Affairs and Global Affairs Canada Vimy Foundation Input of other boards of education in Ontario Explorica Tours and EF Tours Administrators and teachers Students, parents and trustees Insurance providers With this additional information, the current security situation and recognizing the unique historical significance as Canada prepares to mark 100 years since the Battle of Vimy Ridge, we have elected to allow previously scheduled trips to Belgium and France to proceed this Spring. Security and safety of our students and staff remain our primary concerns. Board-related travel to Belgium and France will proceed in March and April, 2017 with a range of additional measures designed to provide a greater level of safety assurance for all travelers. As with any overseas travel, conditions may change between now and the date of departure. The Government of Canada currently advises travelers to exercise a high degree of caution due to the current elevated threat of terrorism. We will continue to monitor the security situation in Belgium and France and further communication and decision-making may be required if the Government of Canada changes its travel advisory information for the relevant countries. Additional safety considerations WRDSB will require all staff and students travelling to Belgium and France in Spring 2017 to complete a mandatory travel safety workshop before departure. We will provide further details on these workshops soon. We will also require a minimum number of trip supervisors to be first aid and CPR-trained, a higher supervisor-to-student ratio and international roaming plans for supervisor smartphones.  WRDSB staff are working to put these arrangements in place. We also require our travel providers to ensure that measures such as transportation seating plans, itinerary contingency plans and more are prepared and recorded with us before departure. Cancellation information We recognize that some travelers may wish to reevaluate their participation in these trips. WRDSB will work with travel companies to provide full refunds to those who cancel with the trip provider before December 16, 2016. After December 16, 2016, refunds will be based on cancellation insurance with travel companies. We regret any inconvenience this process may have caused. We look forward to working together to ensure that these trips proceed safely and that students are afforded a rich and rewarding learning experience.   Update: Monday, November 21, 2016 Waterloo Region District School Board staff provided an update to trustees tonight on the status of the review into the decision to cancel all previously scheduled travel to Belgium and France. No decisions have yet been taken. However, we expect to be able to confirm of the outcome of the review on Monday, November 28. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Update: Monday, November 14, 2016 The Waterloo Region District School Board will review its decision to cancel all previously scheduled travel to Belgium and France. Staff will provide an update on the review to Trustees at the November 21 meeting of the Committee of the Whole and we will provide further information to students and parents as it becomes available. Friday, November 11, 2016 With deep regret the Waterloo Region District School Board has made the decision to cancel all previously scheduled travel to Belgium and France. We understand the disappointment this decision causes our students, staff and families. Our primary concern is always the safety and security of our students and staff – each and every one. We rely on the expertise of the Government of Canada Travel Advice and Advisory website to provide us with information relating to the safety and well-being of our students when travelling abroad. Currently, the Government of Canada is advising travellers to “exercise a high degree of caution” when travelling to Belgium and France. Our Administrative Procedure 1580 Off Campus Categories I II III indicates that “only countries with a designation of ëExercise Normal Security Precautionsí will be considered as destinations.” The board is taking steps to fully reimburse all students who paid a deposit to attend trips to the Vimy Ridge commemoration in April 2017. On Monday, we will send letters to the parents and caregivers of the affected students to inform them of this decision.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News REMINDER: Changes to WiFi access begin January 3, 2017 Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders REMINDER: Changes to WiFi access begin January 3, 2017 December 20th, 2016 Contents 1Why are we introducing these changes? 2How to maintain your access 3Supervision and digital citizenship On January 3, 2017, WRDSB is introducing changes to the filtering of internet content on our password-free wireless network, WRDSB Wireless. These changes mean that if you continue to connect using WRDSB Wireless you will no longer be able to access some popular websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Vimeo. You can continue to access the same sites as today – on any device – by logging in to the WRDSB Secure wireless network using your WRDSB login and password. Follow the easy steps to make the switch to WRDSB Secure today. Why are we introducing these changes? Over the course of the past year, parents and community members raised concerns regarding the effectiveness of our internet content filters. In the course of that debate, we identified a common goal: we all want to ensure that our students stay safe online and that this school district has practices that encourage student development as safe digital citizens, able to navigate the internet and use technology in ways that support their learning and well-being and that prepare them for a world where pervasive, open access to the Internet is a reality. Although our existing firewall/filter protection denies access to millions of undesirable sites, we know that the protection is imperfect and that students and/or community members indicate that they can access inappropriate content from time to time. For this reason, we have elected to provide an even greater assurance on the levels of protection by implementing a graduated filtering approach that will require user or device identification before they can access our network. This change will take effect on January 3, 2017. Access to a login-free WiFi network will continue with extremely limited access to the internet after this date. How to maintain your access For everyone with a PAL username and password, the sites you can visit will not change if you make the switch to WRDSB Secure – a fully encrypted network. All WRDSB shared devices will be pre-configured to use this network. Staff and students using personal devices or Chromebooks can use this network and the good news is that login is automatic after the first use. Device-specific instructions are available. Supervision and digital citizenship We all want to ensure that our students stay safe online – and this means more than simply applying internet filtering controls. Adult supervision of student access and use of technology continues to play an important role in ensuring online safety and in cultivating digital citizenship. All staff who work with students, are encouraged to understand, consider and implement the following best practices for teachers and classrooms (adapted from The Association of Library Consultants and Coordinators of Ontario): Familiarize yourself with the WRDSB’s Responsible Use Procedure (RUP) and connect these guidelines to your own practice. Understand and manage your classroom online activities, empowering students to manage their own digital footprints in order to protect their privacy and safety. Model responsible use of technology to help students learn to how to become responsible digital citizens. Make relationships between character education and digital citizenship so that these values can be applied to various situations. Encourage effective strategies to search for information (e.g., keywords, narrowing a search) and the use of credible online resources (e.g., databases, encyclopedias, ebooks). Observe and monitor students as they use board technology or personal devices to ensure they access appropriate sources (i.e., sites, videos, images). Be aware of copyright guidelines for Canadian educators and teach information skills of ethical use and attribution (citation) of sources. Integrate social networking technology (i.e., Twitter, blogging, YouTube, etc.) as instructional, research and communication tools to model constructive use. Regularly review and follow terms of service regarding parental permission and age restrictions for online tools. Refer to the IS-09-L-E (Elementary) or IS-09-L-S (Secondary) forms that are to be kept in the school office when posting student photos to the web or social media in accordance with Administrative Procedure 1090. More information and resources are available online.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Important information for families regarding opioid-related drug overdoses and deaths Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Important information for families regarding opioid-related drug overdoses and deaths June 29th, 2017 Contents 1There can be different reasons why kids use drugs, including: 2Some signs and symptoms of drug use among kids: 3What can I do to support my child when it comes to substance use? 4Additional resources: This information is shared in cooperation with Region of Waterloo Public Health, Waterloo Regional Police Service, and the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. Dear Parents and Caregivers, Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. Parenting your child/children is the most important job you will ever experience. As parents and caregivers, it is important to be aware of the risks of drugs, including overdose. Ontario and Waterloo Region have seen a rise in opioid-related deaths in recent years. There are many factors contributing to the rise of overdoses in our community, one being the presence of a drug called fentanyl. According to the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario, the number of drug-related overdose and deaths in Ontario is increasing. Local data shows that the number of overdose deaths in Waterloo Region doubled between 2009 and 2015 and continues to rise. On June 27, 2017, Waterloo Regional Police Services reported that there were 35 suspected overdose related deaths in Waterloo Region since the start of the year, that’s nearly as many deaths as the entire 2015 year. Being a parent/caregiver in the current climate of social media can be very difficult and stressful. As a parent/caregiver, we constantly worry about the safety of our children. Drugs are part of our society and the best way to decrease harms is to have accurate information. We are hoping this letter will allow you to start a conversation with your child about the current issues of drug use, including the risks of overdose, the use of prescription medications (from a pharmacy or made on the street) and the dangers of combining drugs with alcohol. This approach includes both preventing substance use and decreasing harms to our youth who are using drugs. Overdose does not discriminate – it can happen to anyone’s family. It is important to equip ourselves with knowledge about drug use including the signs and symptoms of overdose and what to do in an overdose situation. Part of this includes reminding youth that a person who calls 911 in an overdose situation is protected from police charges of drug possession (Bill C-224/Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act). As we approach the end of the school year we would like to remind parents/caregivers about the importance of this issue. Having supportive conversations is a good place to start. For more information and support please visit www.waterlooregiondrugstrategy.ca We have included more detailed information below to help you start a conversation at home. We thank you for taking the time to read this information letter. There can be different reasons why kids use drugs, including: Curiosity Escape – usually from emotional pain To relate to others better, peer pressure Copying behaviour of older siblings To get a rush On a dare Substance use happening at home Low self-esteem Deal with negative feelings Some signs and symptoms of drug use among kids: Problems at school – missing class and getting poor grades Increased secrecy about possessions, friends, and activities Use of incense, room deodorant, or perfume to hide smoke or chemical odours Increased need for money or missing money Drug related posts on social media Less attention to personal care/hygiene Increase in sleeping/naps. Nodding off at inappropriate times; or Increase in hyperactivity outside of what is usual Missing prescription drugs – especially narcotics and sedatives from home or grandparents’ home Parents/caregivers may also find items in their teen’s room that indicate drug use. These include: Drug paraphernalia (such as bongs, pipes, small baggies, pills, powder, needles and rolling papers) Inhalant products (such as hairspray, nail polish, correction fluid or household products) Other unusual over the counter medicines such as cough medicine Rags and paper bags, which may be used as accessories with inhalants Eye drops, which may be used to mask bloodshot eyes and dilated pupils What can I do to support my child when it comes to substance use? Strong, open relationships between parents or caregivers and children decrease the likelihood that teens will abuse drugs. As a parent or caregiver, it is important to talk to your children about drugs and alcohol. Start early and keep the lines of communication open. Discuss a broad range of issues not limited to substance use with your child and invite their opinions even if they are different from your own. Let your child know their safety comes first and they can depend on you to help them if they feel concerned about their own or a friend’s safety. Set an example by being responsible about your own use of alcohol and other drugs. Stay in the know. You don’t have to be an expert. Recognize that experimentation and mistakes happen. Help your child to reflect on a mistake but be sure to wait until you are both calm. It is good to know the symptoms of drug use among teenagers. Keep in mind that some signs of drug use overlap with very common teenage behaviours (such as moodiness and withdrawal) Where can I get more support and information?

The staff and students at SJAM will mourn the victims and hope for a quick recovery for the wounded. This attack, combined with the immigration policy enacted in the United States in the past week, have resulted in challenging times for our diverse community.

Together we are strong and hopeful. The Exam schedule makes this a difficult time for us to connect with all of our students.  Thus, through this message, I would like to remind you that our Guidance and support staff can be reached at the school this week if any SJAM student is in need of support.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Thank you for a wonderful school year Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Thank you for a wonderful school year June 30th, 2017 It is hard to believe that another academic school year has come and gone. As our students prepare to move on to their next chapter, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on the past school year. This year we asked you to help us define what public education in Waterloo region means, by helping us create our new purpose statement. We asked, and you provided us with great feedback. Thanks to your input, our Strategic Plan has come to life, and together, we are “Innovating tomorrow by educating today.” We also set ambitious targets for us to monitor and implement strategies to make sure our students are realizing their full potential. We have finished our first year of monitoring our EQAO scores, graduation rates and student and staff well-being and are actively implementing strategies to help us reach our goals. At our first Town Hall meeting in February, we asked for your feedback on our goals and Strategic Plan. Your input is essential to our success. We believe that parents and caregivers are our partners in their child’s learning journey and working together is how our students will achieve. While we accomplished a great amount this year, we still have an exciting and ambitious road ahead. Reaching our goals will take time and we are well on our way to continued success. This summer will offer us all a chance to recharge and prepare for September. Many of our staff are retiring and starting a new career in their lives; thank you for all you have contributed to the WRDSB and public education. To our students who are starting university, college or an apprenticeship, I wish you success as you continue your education. To all of our students and staff returning this fall, I hope you take time over the summer to relax and recharge. And finally, to our staff working through the summer, thank you for your hard work to make sure our schools are ready to welcome back students and staff for a new school year. I look forward to our continued work together and welcoming you all back in September.

Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News EA and CYW Appreciation Day Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders EA and CYW Appreciation Day January 19th, 2018 We are a public school district for everyone – no matter their background or ability. To help every child in our district achieve their potential, we rely on the support of parents and caregivers and, of course, the hard work of every member of staff. Today we recognize some of the staff who support some of our most vulnerable children. Today is Educational Assistants and Child Youth Worker Appreciation day at Waterloo Region District School Board. Educational Assistants (EA) help to deliver educational programs in our schools. Child Youth Workers (CYW) are mental health professionals who work with troubled children who face a variety of emotional, behavioural or physical problems. We are partnering with the WRDSB Educational Assistants Association (WRDSB EAA) to mark a day of appreciation for these important staff to coincide with the group’s 30th Anniversary as a Trade Union on January 19, 1988. WRDSB EAA have shared a number of letters from community members who are marking their appreciation for the work that EAs and CYWs do in our schools. We encourage you to join the community and WRDSB in marking your appreciation for this important group of staff. As is so often the case, students say it best. So please check out this speech that Ryan Barnes, a former KCI student and former student Trustee, gave to our Educational Assistants and Child and Youth Workers at a PD Day last year.   EAs and CWYs were a major part of Ryan’s school experience, and as he prepared to leave KCI for the next step on his journey, he spoke about the value this important group of staff adds to the life of students across our district. Here’s Ryan’s speech: It gives me great pleasure to bring you greetings on behalf of the Waterloo Region District School Board and School Board Trustees. However, I’m not only here today to bring greetings, but also to share my deepest gratitude to the work of CYWs and EAs, as they have made a significant impact on my life. When I was approached to address you, I was more than thrilled to speak. It’s one of the awesome advantages of being a Student Trustee. You get to wake up early and go to a seminar to give a speech while all your friends are off (sleeping in). Really though, it is a huge honour to be here today to thank an amazing group of people like you. Both CYWs and EAs have a huge impact on the lives of so many students in our schools. Students who struggle in some way, face extra challenges throughout high school, including dealing with labels. Labels are the worst thing. They create stigma. Labels sometimes get in the way of determining the capabilities and potential of a student. For the most part, all of those biases and prejudices are unintentional. As educators, parents, caregivers, trustees and community members ultimately we know as students that you want to see us succeed and to see us reach our fullest potential. This is why EAs and CYWs are imperative within our system. Both CYWs and EAs provide students with hope and resiliency and make them believe that they are something greater. You help us see past the labels, our problems and issues and most importantly show us what we really are capable of. That is the ultimate power. Your ability to directly change lives and influence students is phenomenal and is appreciated by many, including myself. Just know that there are people out there that are impacted by the work you do and those students who you have a hard time with will eventually be thankful for your support – I know I am. This year is my fifth year. The beauty of being a fifth-year student is that you have time to reflect on life and educational experiences and how it has shaped you. A question that has been lingering in my mind for awhile is “How did I become the person I am today?” I am confident that if EAs and CYWs weren’t a part of my life, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. I was fortunate to have a strong support system throughout my time at KCI. Many EAs and CYWs, some of whom are in this room, have helped me overcome many obstacles and life challenges. Throughout my life, people have pointed out how I am different from others because of my hearing loss. I have been pushed over the edge and been bullied. I’ve encountered days where I felt disconnected and lonely. I’ve had many social and speech problems while growing up. Coming from Cambridge and entering high school at KCI and starting from scratch was very difficult for me. Grade 9 and 10 were difficult years. I was distant and extremely shy. Both CYWs and EAs helped me overcome these obstacles and as a result, I gained the skills to become more independent and confident. Looking back 10 years, even 5 years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined myself being the person that I am today, let alone standing up here giving this speech. It is unbelievable. I am a Student Trustee of the Waterloo Region District School Board, a Student Council Co-Premier at KCI, and an advisor on a variety of committees pertaining to staff and student wellbeing. All of you made that possible, both directly and indirectly. I am proud of the person I have become. On behalf of the Trustees, myself and all the students in your care, we thank you for the important work you do every day.

Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Talking to your child about opioids Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Talking to your child about opioids December 22nd, 2017 Dear Parents and Caregivers, Once again, we are sending families important information about opioid-related drug overdoses and urging you to speak with your children about staying safe. On December 2, 2017, Waterloo Regional Police Services reported that 65 people in our region died as a result of a suspected overdose. This is a 71 per cent increase from 2016. The drug fentanyl is to blame in many of these overdoses. Fentanyl is a very potent drug that people may take on purpose; however more and more there are reports of fentanyl being added to other substances. Fentanyl has been found in drugs that you swallow, smoke and inject. Overdose can happen to anyone’s family. As we approach the holiday season, please make time to have conversations with your children about how they can stay safe. As caregivers, there is a lot you can do to help your children understand the risks of drug use. Having open and supportive conversations about substance use and overdose is an approach we know works well for young people. Talk to your children about real versus fake medications. It is often impossible to tell the difference between a prescription pill and a fake pill made illegally on the street. You can’t see, smell or taste fentanyl. Talk about how opioids can be mixed in with other drugs on purpose or by accident and that there is a risk of opioid overdose even if they are not using an opioid (for example fentanyl). Talk about the danger of combining drugs with alcohol, which increases risk of an overdose. Talk to your child about what an overdose looks like and what to do if they see someone who may need help. Make a safety plan with your child if they are out with their friends. Let them know that it is always safe to call you if they are concerned about their own or a friend’s wellbeing. Tell your child to call 911 if they believe someone is overdosing. The Good Samaritan Act means they will not be charged with drug possession. Many youth are afraid to call 911 for fear that the police will charge them or that they will be in trouble with their parents. Let them know that their safety and their friends’ safety is what matters most. If you or someone you love uses a prescription opioid, or may be at risk of an overdose because they use drugs, you can get a free Naloxone kit. Naloxone is medicine that will reverse an opioid overdose for a short period of time until an ambulance can arrive to help. It saves lives. Remember, young people are experimental. It is important to return your old or unused prescription medications – youth often get drugs from home or from their friends’ homes. The following videos and resources provide more information about drug use among youth and can help you talk with your children about the signs of an overdose, fentanyl, naloxone and calling 911. #thenewFword’ – Waterloo Regional Police Services Video Naloxone administration and the signs and symptoms of overdose 2017 Ontario Student Drugs Use & Health Survey Study – highlights  Many organizations in Waterloo Region work in partnership to address overdose, opioid use and substance issues.

Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders News & Announcements SJAM Response to Weekend Events Posted January 30, 2017 Principal’s Remarks: SJAM Cares I would like to address and reassure the SJAM community in the wake of a troubled weekend in Canada and the United States.   I would like to echo the sentiments expressed by our Prime Minister in condemning the attack on Muslims in a place of worship on Sunday evening. The staff and students at SJAM will mourn the victims and hope for a quick recovery for the wounded. This attack, combined with the immigration policy enacted in the United States in the past week, have resulted in challenging times for our diverse community. It is worth emphasizing at this time of tragedy that the SJAM staff would like to do everything we can to support our students in their feeling of safety.  School is a place where we can come together from a wide variety of backgrounds to learn together in an environment of belonging and acceptance.  This weekend’s events remind us that there is much work to be done to fully achieve this vision.  I believe, with the help of our students, our dedicated staff, and our community, that here at SJAM we can work together to achieve this vision. Together we are strong and hopeful. The Exam schedule makes this a difficult time for us to connect with all of our students.  Thus, through this message, I would like to remind you that our Guidance and support staff can be reached at the school this week if any SJAM student is in need of support.

They are asking those who live, work and go to school in Waterloo region for their opinion on these services. You can have your say on Supervised Injection Services through the region’s online survey. To participate in the survey you must be 16 years of age or older. What are Supervised Injection Services? Communities across Canada are experiencing substance use issues, including overdose. Region of Waterloo Public Health continues to work with the Waterloo Integrated Drugs Strategy on a community opioid response. Part of this response includes exploring the feasibility of supervised injection services. Supervised injection services provide a safe, clean space as well as supplies for people to inject their own drugs under the care of trained staff. Supervised injection services are being considered because research shows they:    Prevent overdose deaths    Reduce used needles left in public places    Connect people who inject drugs with needed services    Reduce needle sharing and the spread of infection In order to operate a supervised injection service location, an exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act must be granted by the Federal Minister of Health. Consultation with the community, such as this survey, is a large part of the federal exemption application process. No decisions have yet been made about providing supervised injection services in Waterloo region.

Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Committed to student belonging on Halloween, and everyday. October 17th, 2017 Halloween is just around the corner and this day that can be filled with excitement for many children. Halloween is often recognized with costumes and school activities, however it is important that schools continue to create a sense of belonging for each and every student. We recognize that not all families celebrate Halloween. October 31 is a school day like any other, and we want families to feel that they can send their children to school without disruption. Teachers will offer activities that include all students, whether they are celebrating Halloween or not. Costumes If you do decide to send your child off to school in a costume on Halloween, please check with your school on any guidelines they may have provided. Any costumes worn at school must be appropriate and respectful of others. If something is representative of a person’s culture or religious beliefs, then it should not be worn as another person’s costume. Also please be aware that, for safety reasons, we do not allow children or adults to wear masks or to carry plastic weapons. Weapons, real or fake, are not to be brought to school on any day; Halloween is not an exception. Our students come first and we are committed to creating safe and caring school communities. On Halloween, and everyday, let’s continue to create an environment where every child feels included, valued and treated with dignity.

Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News School bus driver availability Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders School bus driver availability October 6th, 2017 School bus operators are currently experiencing a school bus driver shortage. This shortage is being experienced across the province, and Student Transportation Services of Waterloo Region (STSWR) has until this year been able to provide consistent service to all schools. For the region’s public and Catholic schools, 426 bus routes have been contracted to provide home to school transportation, 7 of which have no permanent driver. In addition, the pool of temporary/substitute drivers needs to be augmented by 30 new staff for service to return to normal levels. These shortages may result in certain students experiencing delays when travelling to school or going home. We are working to minimize issues where possible, and in most cases, families will see no impact resulting from the driver shortage. Bus operators have increased their recruitment and training activities to ensure we return to normal levels of service in the near future. The process of training and certifying a school bus driver takes time to complete as it requires individuals to undergo training, testing, and background checks before they are qualified to be road ready. Based on the information we have today, it is expected that service levels at all schools will return to normal within 60 days. Please call us if you have any questions at 519-650-4934.

Whether it is high tech innovation or social innovation – changing our society and communities to become better places to live and work and raise a family – we know that Waterloo Region District School Board is a part of this rich community of world-class innovation. As leaders, it’s our role to inspire our staff to see the potential in our students and to help our students imagine these futures for themselves. Today is World Teacher’s Day, a day we come together to reflect on the dedication and passion of teachers who are working to inspire the 63,000 students in this district to reach their potential and accomplish great things for Canada in the future. October 5 is designated as World Teachers’ Day by UNESCO, a day devoted to improving and appreciating educators throughout the world. “Teaching in Freedom, Empowering Teachers” is the theme of this year’s World Teachers’ Day. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for Education requires teachers to enjoy professional independence, freedom and the tools needed to deliver quality education, which must take into account learners’ circumstances, needs and expectations. Classrooms across our region are safe and inclusive, thanks to the freedom that our teachers, early childhood educators, educational assistants, child youth workers and many more have to work together to inspire the children of this region. On behalf of the senior team and union partners, we would like to wish all of our teachers a happy World Teachers’ Day. Thank you for everything you do to innovate tomorrow by educating today.

Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News WRDSB wears orange on September 29 Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders WRDSB wears orange on September 29 September 28th, 2017 WRDSB recognizes Orange Shirt Day as a way to honour residential school survivors, those who did not survive, and their descendants. It’s just one of the ways we support, educate and reconcile our relationship with Indigenous people. What is Orange Shirt Day? Orange Shirt Day is observed September 30 and was first launched in 2013. The origin of Orange Shirt Day is based on Phyllis Webstad’s story of entering an Indian Residential School in 1973 and having her new orange shirt removed from her and replaced with a school uniform. Her experience of having her orange shirt being taken from her is symbolic of all that was taken from Indigenous peoples as a result of Indian Residential Schools and is the reason we wear orange on September 30. For well over a century, Indian Residential Schools were used as a tool to assimilate Indigenous peoples into the dominant Canadian culture. Established in 1892 by the Canadian government, in partnership with churches, Indigenous children were often moved long distances from their families and lived at the schools. Once at school, Indigenous children were forbidden to speak their languages nor practice their cultures and traditions. Living conditions for students in Indian Residential Schools were often harsh and there was often significant emotional, physical and sexual abuse of the students. WRDSB Orange Shirt Day Activities Since September 30 falls on a Saturday in 2017, WRDSB will acknowledge Orange Shirt Day on Friday, September 29, 2017. Please tag images of how you are honouring Orange Shirt Day by mentioning @wrdsb on Twitter or @wr_dsb on Instagram and using the hashtag #IndigenousWRDSB.

Macdonald Secondary School) Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home of the Highlanders Contact Information Toggle navigation Toggle navigation Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News Principal’s Statement on School Name Issue Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders Principal’s Statement on School Name Issue September 6th, 2017 As has been widely reported in the news, the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario has put forth motion calling for school boards to rename any schools named after Sir John A. MacDonald, including our school. As the Principal I am very aware that we as educators bear a responsibility to teach our students how to research facts, how to analyze and weigh perspectives, and how to use critical thinking in important societal debates such as this one over a historical figure.   While the public scrutiny provides an interesting angle, I believe the question before us all also provides an exciting educational and community challenge; an opportunity for SJAM students, staff, parents, and community members to provide valuable perspective on our cultural identity in the context of the debate about the person our school is named for. In my experience, our SJAM students are capable of calm perspective and keen problem-solving that may help us all move forward towards a collaborative solution. While such school name decisions are not made at the school level, we know we will have a role to play. My administrative team has already begun work on how we can engage in this discussion with our students under our existing inclusive schools initiatives. In term of the question for our community of “what will happen to our school name?”, the WRDSB has made the following statement regarding its approach: “WRDSB is aware of the ETFO recommendation. We want ensure that our schools are safe spaces and inclusive of all students, staff and community members. A name change here is not yet under consideration, but our board of trustees has a policy on the naming of schools, and trustees will be keen to hear the views of our students, staff and community members in light of the recommendation. As a public board of education, it is important that we provide a safe space to discuss changing perspectives on Canada’s shared history and historical figures. This is an important topic that requires thoughtful dialogue with all of our partners in education.” As always, if you have any questions regarding this, or any, school issue, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Macdonald Secondary School Home Calendar Guidance Library Academics Activities Athletics About Home News WRDSB joins University of Waterloo HeForShe gender equity initiative Upcoming Events @SJAMHighlanders Tweets by @SJAMHighlanders WRDSB joins University of Waterloo HeForShe gender equity initiative September 7th, 2017 Contents 1HeForShe Writing Contest 1.1Submission guidelines 1.2Judging 1.3More information WRDSB schools and youth are joining the University of Waterloo in supporting the UN Women’s HeForShe movement. Starting this fall, WRDSB and the University are inviting all students in Grades 9 to 12 to enter the University of Waterloo’s HeForShe Writing Contest. This contest is in its second year. HeForShe is a global effort to engage men and boys in removing the social and cultural barriers that prevent women and girls from achieving their potential, and together positively reshaping society. “I am very proud to have been Waterloo’s co-lead on the HeForShe IMPACT initiative, so I am thrilled to be able to bring the project to WRDSB,” said Nick Manning, chief communication officer. “The HeForShe movement has inspired so many young people to join the effort to create gender equity, so it is exciting to expand that effort to our public school district.” HeForShe Writing Contest Gender equity calls for all of our voices and all of our stories. To achieve lasting change, we must connect experiences of gender to a diverse understanding of equity in the Waterloo community and in our world. For the first time, Waterloo Region District School Board students are invited to share their stories, real and imagined, about building a better and more equitable world. The 2017-18 contest theme is INTERSECTIONS. Participants are asked to consider how gender equity fits into the larger equity story. Where are the overlaps and connections between gender and race, ethnicity, age, ability, class, faith, and/or sexuality? How do the perspectives of gender equity connect to the goal of equality for all people? Can working towards gender equity help to advance equity conversations more broadly? Through poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction, we welcome students reflections on the past and your hopes, dreams, and directions for the future. When gender equity is connected to the dream of equality for everyone, how is our world made better? Your stories are a part of the Waterloo landscape — today and tomorrow. In what ways are you #HeForShe? The University will award a $500 prize for the top submission in each category (poetry, creative non-fiction, and fiction). Selected submissions will also be included in a special University of Waterloo anthology on gender equity that will be published on March 8, 2018 — International Women’s Day. The youth category winners will also be invited to attend the University’s International Women’s Day dinner with a parent or teacher. The contest is open to WRDSB students – boys and girls – in Grades 9 to 12. Submissions must not have been previously published. Pieces submitted as part of school work will be accepted. Submission guidelines Submissions are due by October 20, 2017. Eligibility Requirements Contest is open to all WRDSB students in Grades 9 to 12. Submissions must not have been previously published in any other forum, whether print or online. However, pieces that were previously submitted as part of school work will be accepted. Entrants must consent to the publication of their work, whether in print or online. Entrants must consent to editing of their work for grammar and typos, as needed. Content and Genre Requirements Submissions must fall into one of three broad categories: fiction, creative non-fiction, or poetry. The 2017-18 contest theme is intersections. Participants are asked to consider how gender equity fits into the larger equity story. Formatting Requirements Entrants may submit more than one entry, but each entry must be no longer than 5000 words. Submissions must be received in Google Doc, .doc, .docx, or .pdf format. Submissions must include a word count at the end of the document. Fiction and creative non-fiction submissions should be double-spaced. If a poem moves on to a second page, indicate stanza breaks with a backslash (/), as needed. If submission is more than one page, include page numbers. Submission Submissions should be emailed to heforshe@wrdsb.ca. Submissions can be made anonymously, but our preference is for the submission to include the student’s name, age, grade, school and a teacher contact. Judging A panel of WRDSB staff will judge entries in each category to recommend to University judges the top three entries for publication. The University will select the winners. Download the University of Waterloo HeForShe Writing Contest Flyer More information We have shared copies of the inaugural University of Waterloo anthology with secondary principals as well as a stack of posters/flyers for distribution in schools. Please talk to your teacher or principal if you would like to participate or email questions to heforshe@wrdsb.ca.
